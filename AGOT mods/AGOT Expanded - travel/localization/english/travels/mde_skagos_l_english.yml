 mde_skagos.0001.desc: "#high Even before I set foot on the isle’s shoreline, a darkness seemed to loom over it. I am left to wonder, what madness drove me to the most remote isle in all the Seven Kingdoms?\n\nThe island is little more than a jagged cluster of rocks thrust up from a restless sea,with  each wave threatening to swallow it whole. Here and there, patches of green cling to the hills above, and a few wind-bent trees stand like sentries against the sky.\n\nChildhood tales crowd my thoughts, stories of Unicorns and Stonemen, and even the last sighting of the great beast [cannibal.GetName], that dread dragon never tamed nor ridden.\n\nAnd still I ask myself: #italic why am I here?#!#!"

 mde_skagos.0001.a.f: "If it is here, I will find it, no matter how long it takes!"
 mde_skagos.0001.b: "Lets move on."
 mde_skagos.0001.b.f: "All we will find are old bones..."

 mde_skagos.0101.t: "The Search for Cannibal"
 mde_skagos.0101.desc: "From one small settlement to the next we go, trading where we must, asking questions where we can. While the stout and small Smallfolk are happy to speak of unicorns and dragons, we have yet to see any.\n\nStill, one tale catches my ear: a story of scorched stone and claw marks high atop the island’s tallest peak. Is this tale worth pursuing?"
 mde_skagos.0101.a: "Climb and search the mountain!"
 mde_skagos.0101.b: "Let's move on already."

 mde_skagos.0102.desc: "Up and up we climb. Ahead walks a local man, willing to lead us to the so-called lair. Behind me, two mules plod along, laden with provisions for the journey. After hours, after days, after uncountable steps, we finally reach the top.\n\nBefore me yawns a great opening in the mountainside, its mouth strewn with bones of every shape and size, both within and without. The rocks are blackened, claw-marked, scarred. And yet, judging by the age of the remains, nothing has stirred here in many years."
 mde_skagos.0102.a: "Let's study the place and move on."

The rocks are blackened, claw-marked, scarred. And yet, judging by the age of the remains, nothing has stirred here in many years.\n\nMy hands are caked in filth, my clothes torn and sweat-soaked, every muscle aching. I sift through bones, rusted mail, broken helms, rotted tools, until something catches my eye. Scales!\n\nWith a jolt, I leap back, heart pounding, half-expecting some ancient beast to rise from the dark. But as I draw closer, brushing away the ash and dust, I see it for what it is…"
 mde_skagos.0103.a: "Take it!"
