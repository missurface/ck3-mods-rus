But the slaughter did not go as planned. Steel clashed with steel, tables overturned, and the hall erupted into madness.\n\n Mother's screams cut through the chaos and mingled with the battle cries of my honor guard who refused to die quietly. \n\nIn the blur of movement and blood, I could no longer tell who was winning—only that we were fighting back. \n\n The Starks weren’t dead yet. Not all of us."
