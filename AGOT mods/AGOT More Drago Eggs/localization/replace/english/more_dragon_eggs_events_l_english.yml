Neither the Targaryens or the Order of the Dragonkeepers were able to contain the monstrous beast, much less stop him from feasting on his kin.\n\nIn recorded history, [cannibal.GetNamePossessive] appearance is as mysterious as his disappearance , as very little is known about either. Many say that his birth predated the birth of the Conquerors' dragons.\n\nIt is known, however, that [cannibal.GetName] disappeared some time after The Dance of Dragons. Though some have speculated that he might have flown off into the heart of Skagos, drawn by those of similar nature. You think that this may have been more than speculation, evidenced by the dragonglass scarring the forest floor around you."

One of these roamed the Vale, a skittish dragon that was particularly fond of lamb, earning him his namesake; [sheepstealer.GetName].\n\nThis was taken advantage of by only the hypothetical non-Targaryen descended dragonrider in Westeros, [nettles.GetName]. She would tame this dragon by luring him in with sheep every day until he trusted her. She also earned the trust of [daemon.GetName], with rumors claiming her to be either his daughter or his lover.\n\nDuring the Dance, [nettles.GetName] and [sheepstealer.GetName] would disappear, never to be seen again.\n\nThat being said, there is a clan in the Mountains of the Vale known as the Burned Men, who possess a coming of age ritual that involves their boys bringing gifts to the Fire Witch, avoiding the wrath of her flames in order to prove their manhood. Many speculate that the Fire Witch is [nettles.GetName]"

You follow this path, nervously, until it leads to the mouth of an enormous cave.\n\nAfter waiting still for what seems like an eternity, listening for any sound from the cave, you proceed in. The cave is marked across all of its surfaces, in either a deep, red paint or even more dragonglass, and bones litter the floor.\n\nEventually, you reach the center of the cave, where it seems there is a ceremonial pit. At the heart of the ceremonial pit, is a giant mound of skulls of all sorts, rabbits, bears, deer, giants, unicorns, and humans. At the top though is a skull larger than any other, and it shines a wicked green from its eye.\n\nYou treacherously ascend the mound and find a treasure unlike anything else! A dragon egg!"

Some of them have varying degrees of burns, down to the bones.\n\nWhether by luck or skill, or both, you find your way to the cave of the Fire Witch, without encountering any Burned Men, inside you see the walls are covered in thousands of markings, almost like a grey rat maester had gone mad without paper. Hidden in the corner, is a dusty, brown dragon egg!"

A shrouded figure with glowing green eyes peaks its head out from behind the thick cove of weirwood trees, filling me with dread until I pass out.\n\nI awakened back on the shore of the Gods Eye, and disoriented, alarmed by the discovery of a dragon egg in my hands!"

An alliance had been brokered between the Greens and the Triarchy, culminating in a massive armada slamming into the Velaryon blockade of the Gullet, a strategic chokepoint that denied supply access to King’s Landing\n\nThe battle ended in a pyrrhic victory for the Blacks, who managed to hold their blockade and defeat the Triarchy’s armada, at great cost. The crown prince [jaecaerys.GetName] and his dragon, [vermax.GetName], were both slain, and Spicetown was burned to ashes.

While kicking around the scattered stones on the floor, a glitter of color flashes in the corner of my eye, jarring in its contrast to the black and grays of the destruction around me.\n\nI pry the colorful stones away from the ground and stare in shock at what I have in my hands.

The most historically reverberative of these legends is the legend of [nagga.GetName], whose great bones serve as a place of great cultural significance to the Ironborn. It was the seat of [grey_king.GetName] and served as the location of the Kingsmoot for many centuries.\n\nIronborn tales say that [nagga.GetName] was the first sea dragon, who fed on leviathans and krakens, and whose ferocity was so great that she could drown entire islands. Tales of such feats only serve to mythologize the prowess of [grey_king.GetName], who slew the mighty beast, and raised his hall with her bones, warmed it with her living fire, made his throne from her jaw, and his crown from her teeth.\n\nNow the sight is eerily quiet, but the titanic bones haunt me with a megalophobic sense of dread."

I will heed the call of destiny if it commands me, and I almost intuitively walk to the exposed shoreline, following in the steps of the ancient Kingsmoot. As I approach the water, there are a number of ancient weapons, rusted and covered in corals and barnacles. I delve into the deep, baptizing myself in salt, letting the sea fill my lungs.\n\nI black out, with my last memory being of something powerful, mayhaps a being of some kind, and something in my hands.

When I approach the castle, I notice the main tower has yet to be repaired since the Conquest.\n\nThe destruction was the result of the infamous death of the dragonrider [rhaenys.GetName], and her she-dragon, [meraxes.GetName]. At the time of her death, [rhaenys.GetName] had been on a campaign to suppress the resistant Dornish using dragonfire to burn their castles. The Ullers of the Hellholt did what no one else had managed, and fire a scorpion bolt directly through the eye of [meraxes.GetName] sending both rider and dragon plummeting to their doom.

Vexed, I work like mad to find the clearest patch of glass I can.\n\nAfter hours of inspecting, I find glass that reveals a golden and silver shimmer.
