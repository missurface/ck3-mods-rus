 mde_filler_dragon.0002.desc: "As my [GetCourtPositionType('wet_nurse_court_position').GetName()] [nursemaid.GetFirstName] #italic bursts #!into my room, a wave of worry; and perhaps a hint of annoyance, washes over me. Raising children, even with attendants, has never been an easy task.\n\nTrailing behind [nursemaid.GetFirstName] comes [older_child.GetFirstName] and [younger_child.GetFirstName], and while [nursemaid.GetSheHe] tries to explain the prank [older_child.GetFirstName] has pulled, the children break into a loud shouting match.\n\nApparently, [older_child.GetFirstName] gifted [younger_child.GetFirstName] a false dragon egg as a jest, and now the joke is the talk of every child in the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]."

 mde_filler_dragon.0004.desc: "Heard across [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], a furious wail suddenly pierces the air, echoing deeply from the nursery.\n\nRushing toward it, I find young [child.GetFirstName] red-faced, pointing accusingly at his cradle [egg_child.GetName]. Tears stain his cheeks as he cries, #italic "I don't want! I want a pretty egg!"#! while he gestures longingly toward my unclaimed [egg.GetName].\n\nMy [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] is already showing both a strong will and an expensive taste! Do I indulge this draconic demand, or teach a lesson in gratitude?"
 mde_filler_dragon.0004.a: "Indulge [child.GetHerHim]."
 mde_filler_dragon.0004.b: "Take back the egg."
 mde_filler_dragon.0004.c: "[child.GetSheHe]’ll forget it tomorrow."

 mde_filler_dragon.0006.desc: "Today, I planned to ride out with my [child_rider.Custom('GetDaughterSon')].

 mde_filler_dragon.0010.desc: "As the war drags on with no end in sight, my council brings forth the same concerns time and again:\n\nFood distribution issues at the markets, raising costs on all products, and growing unrest for the smallfolk.\n\nWhile hardships are expected in wartime, something new troubles me. The smallfolk have gotten a wild idea: that the #bold body#! of a single dragon could feed them forever. Whispers turn to talk, and talk into dangerous hope. The dead beast, they say, would solve every hunger..."
 mde_filler_dragon.0010.a: "Set money aside to manage the unrest."
 mde_filler_dragon.0010.b: "No one can hurt dragons!"
 mde_filler_dragon.0010.c: "Let's show them what dragons #bold really#! are."

 mde_filler_dragon.0011.desc: "At yet another council meeting, good news finally reaches me; the ridiculous notion that a dragon corpse could feed the smallfolk forever has all but faded from the talk on the street.\n\nIt seems the growing population of #italic rats; and other vile, crawling things,#! has provided just enough sustenance to quiet their hunger and keep more maniacal thoughts at bay.\n\nRegardless, there are always more pressing matters to attend to."

 mde_filler_dragon.0012.desc: "While I am deep in discussion with my councilors, my [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillorPosition( 'councillor_castellan' ).GetPositionName] bursts into the chamber. Clear panic shows on [hand.GetHerHis] face, as he tries to explain the situation to us.\n\nThe smallfolk have actually had the audacity to #bold DARE#! assault my property! A roaring mass of ravenous, ungrateful, and traitorous; barely human, has stormed the Dragonpit!\n\nThough the Dragonkeepers, guards, and even the dragons themselves fought back, and the ground is littered with the bodies of the fallen... reports say that #color_red [dead_dragon.GetName]#! has been slaughtered.\n\nThe surviving mass used tools, weapons, anything they could find to pry beneath its sacred scales."
 mde_filler_dragon.0012.a: "The smallfolk will suffer for this!"

A celebration of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyHouseName], and a way to line our coffers with gold.\n\nAll I must do... is keep the beast calm."
 mde_filler_dragon.0018.a: "#italic "Alright, let’s do it."#!"
 mde_filler_dragon.0018.b: "A dragon is not part of a menagerie."

 mde_filler_dragon.0020.t: "A Wasting Dragon"
 mde_filler_dragon.0020.desc: "#italic "How!"#! I demand. #x "HOW!"#! I roar.\n\nNo one answers. The Maesters fumble with scrolls and mutter nonsense. The Septons pray to the Father Above, as if holy words might mend what is already breaking.\n\nDragons do not sicken. Not in tale or tome. Not in the histories sung by bards or carved into stone. Yet when I look upon [ridden_dragon.GetName], I see the truth with my own eyes.\n\nThe beast stirs, sluggish and slow, its limbs trembling with every breath. #italic I feel it too#!, somewhere deep inside me, a shared pain gnawing at bone and spirit.

 mde_filler_dragon.0022.a: "The Smallfolk will pay!"

 mde_filler_dragon.0024.t: "Unperturbed Presence"
 mde_filler_dragon.0024.desc: "Feeding time is usually a controlled chaos, with dragonkeepers warily distributing meat while keeping a safe distance.\n\nYet, [ridden_dragon.GetName] displayed remarkable composure. It waited patiently for its share, allowing keepers to move around it with minimal signs of agitation.\n\nAt one point, a keeper stumbled, sending a bucket clattering to the ground. The sound rang out sharp as steel, but [ridden_dragon.GetName] only lifted its head, watched the man gather himself, and then returned to its meal without so much as a snort.\n\nSuch poise amidst the bustle of human activity suggested a creature unusually comfortable in their world."
 mde_filler_dragon.0024.a: "What a nice dragon."
 mde_filler_dragon.0024.b: "Let's encourage it."

 mde_filler_dragon.0026.desc: "Today's offering was goat, usually a favourite amongst the young dragons. Yet, [ridden_dragon.GetName] merely sniffed at the carcass before turning away, showing no interest.\n\nYesterday, it devoured the offered pig readily enough.\n\nThe feeders observed this pattern repeating: the dragon showed distinct preferences, often refusing perfectly good meat if it wasn't to its liking.\n\nWhile frustrating for the feeders, this discerning palate inadvertently led to less consumption, marking [ridden_dragon.GetName] as unusually restrained in its needs."
 mde_filler_dragon.0026.a: "Fine, feed it what it eats."
 mde_filler_dragon.0026.b: "Starve it, until it eats everything again."

 mde_filler_dragon.0028.desc: "Several reports have reached me in my studies, and there is no denying their truth.\n\nMy dragon, [ridden_dragon.GetName], has attacked a nearby farm, tearing apart their house and barn in search of livestock.\n\nThe dragonkeepers insist that the beast has been well fed, claiming such acts are simply its nature.\n\nYet it falls upon me to answer for this."
 mde_filler_dragon.0028.a: "The smallfolk are not my concern."
 mde_filler_dragon.0028.b: "Provide aid to the ruined families."
 mde_filler_dragon.0028.c: "Confine [ridden_dragon.GetName] to the Dragonpit."

 mde_filler_dragon.0030.t: "An Old Beast"
 mde_filler_dragon.0030.desc: "There’s no denying it. Whenever I visit [ridden_dragon.GetName], the creature moves with a heavy sluggishness, each motion like stone grinding against stone. The dragonkeepers must feed it by hand now; throwing meat into its huge jaws, just to keep it alive.\n\nAnd yet, even in decay, a dragon this old still brings prestige… though at a cost."
 mde_filler_dragon.0030.a: "Finish it off."
 mde_filler_dragon.0030.b: "Accept this reality."
