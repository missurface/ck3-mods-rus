 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.t: "Burnt Bones"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.desc: "After being ushered in by the guards, a middle-aged man kneels before me. His body trembles faintly, head bowed so low his chin nearly touches his chest.\n\nBefore him lies a ragged sheet, slowly unwrapped by shaking hands.\n\n#italic “My boy…”#! he whispers.\n\n#italic “Louder!”#! barks one of my guards, [mde_bad_knight.GetFirstNameNicknamed], but my eyes are already fixed on what lies beneath the cloth.\n\nCharred bones. Blackened, twisted. Small.The man swallows and tries again, pain thick in his voice. #italic “My son, Your Grace… burned by the sky lizard.”#!\n\nThe same guard scoffs. #italic “It’s called a dragon, pathetic smallfolk. Show some respect—”#!\n\n[mde_bad_knight.GetSheHe] stops mid-sentence, as I rise from my seat."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.a: "#italic “Silence! [mde_bad_knight.GetFirstNameNicknamed], you are insufferable. Compensate the man.”#!"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.b: "#italic “Obviously [active_dragon.GetName] would never do this. Take the man to the dungeons.”#!"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.c: "#italic "Enough, the Dragonpit exists to prevent such tragedies"#!"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0001.d: "#italic "Both of you waste my time"#!"

 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.t: "Burnt Village"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.desc: "Before me kneel two men, one old, one young. Both are shaken, their faces drawn and hollow.\n\nThe elder speaks first. #italic “My Grace… a grave accident has occurred. Our village has been razed to the ground.”#!\n\nHe describes the beast that descended upon them, wings blotting out the sun, fire falling like judgment. There is no mistaking it. It could only have been [active_dragon.GetName].\n\nBefore he can finish, the younger man cuts in, his voice sharp with bitterness.#italic “Why do you bother?”#! he spits. #italic “House [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyHouseName] has never cared for us. Look around you; do you truly think they care what happens beyond these walls?”#!\n\nThe elder answers softly, urging restraint, but the words fail. The argument spills out before the court, grief turning to accusation."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.a: "Let them bicker. Their grief may yet amuse the court."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.b: "This is clearly the dragon’s doing. Compensate them for their losses."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.c: "Promise that the beast will be better controlled."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0002.d: "Enough insolence, let them perish as their village did."

 mde_hold_court_dragon.0003.t: "A Strange Gift"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0003.desc: "Before me stands a hooded figure. A man, by his build and voice; yet refuses to show his face.\n\nHis words ring through the hall, calm and certain.\n\n #italic “My liege… dragons gave us peace. Dragons gave us unity. They were the ultimate deterrent.”\n\n“Some still remember. Some still hope. Some still worship.”#! \n\nSlowly, deliberately, the figure produces an object. I hear armor shift as my guards tense—but it is no blade. Instead, a silvery crown catches the light, old and finely wrought.\n\n #italic “A small reward,”#! the man says, #italic “from those who still believe in dragons.”#!"
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0003.a: "Take the crown, kill the heretic."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0003.b: "It is good to see the dragons still inspire loyalty."
 mde_hold_court_dragon.0003.c: "Unholy and corrupt, let [active_dragon.GetName] burn them both."
