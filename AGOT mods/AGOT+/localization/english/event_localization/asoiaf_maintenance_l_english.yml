 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0001_a_desc:0 "Years of relentless pursuit carved away the person I once was. Each fleeting moment of safety only serves to remind me of the assassins one step behind. Begging for shelter from this noble or that... And through it all, the crushing weight of being the last hope of a dynasty — the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen — resting on my shoulders since I was seven years old.\n\n[asoiaf_Targaryen_9.GetFirstName], oblivious to our constant peril, has lived under my protection. I've shielded her from the reality of our life: one where death is but a breath away and trust is a luxury we can't afford. I've been her brother, father, teacher, and shield.\n\nBut years in exile have taken their toll. The tender part of me is gone; kindness is a weakness I can no longer afford. To keep my sister safe and our dynasty alive, I must become a weapon — cold, ruthless, and unyielding."

She was my last tether to the past, my reason to endure the hardship. Without her, the darkness feels even more suffocating, and the path forward more ruthless.

Each day she grows more confident, more powerful, and I'm left in the shadows watching as she outgrows the care I struggled to provide.\n\nHer resolve should fill me with pride, yet all I feel is a gnawing sense of loss and purposeless.\n\nThe whispers questioning my worth grow louder each day.

The timid girl is gone, replaced by a woman who knows her worth and the power she holds.\n\nThis is not the same [asoiaf_Targaryen_9.GetFirstName] I married, she's become something more.

Doubtless the trecherous Martells were involved, perhaps even my very own Kingsguard Ser [asoiaf_Martell_2.GetFirstName]. I'll see to it their doom comes in kind, with fire and blood...\n\nRight now the realm needs an heir more than ever, but should that heir truly be Prince [asoiaf_Targaryen_11.GetFirstName]? Every law of succession would say so, but the boy is too young to serve the realm when it needs him most. And he is half-Martell to boot... half traitor already.\n\nOthers may have forgotten how my son plotted against me these last years, conspiring to depose me or worse.
