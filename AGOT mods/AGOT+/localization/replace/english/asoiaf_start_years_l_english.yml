Prince Rhaegar Targaryen has kidnapped Lyanna Stark, the betrothed of Lord Robert Baratheon. When her father and brother rode south demanding redress for her abduction, the King Aerys II denied them a fair hearing, brutally executing them both. But when the Mad King called for the heads of the young Lords Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale instead raised his banners in rebellion.\n\n#bold As fighting spreads across Westeros like wildfire, it is up to you to decide the fate of the kingdom. For when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.#!"

Robert I Baratheon now sits the Iron Throne, but he soon realises that being a king is not as easy as expected.\n\n“Honour? I’ve got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honour keeps them in line? Do you think it’s honour that’s keeping the peace?#bold  It’s fear — fear and blood!#!”"
