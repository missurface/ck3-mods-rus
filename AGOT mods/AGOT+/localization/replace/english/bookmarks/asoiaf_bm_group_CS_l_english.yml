Robert I Baratheon now sits the Iron Throne, but he soon realises that being a king is not as easy as expected.\n\n“Honour? I’ve got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honour keeps them in line? Do you think it’s honour that’s keeping the peace?#bold  It’s fear — fear and blood!#!”"

But his daughter, Cersei, cares little and less for her father's machinations, preferring her own schemes and plots. His golden son, Jaime, will forever be known as the 'Kingslayer'. And his heir, young Tyrion, will never stand tall in his father’s eyes.\n\n#bold Whether it be in service to the realm, or to its detriment, how will the great lion improve his House's future?#!"
