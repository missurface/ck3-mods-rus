I've shielded her from the reality of our life: one where death is but a breath away and trust is a luxury we can't afford. I've been her brother, father, teacher, and shield.\n\nBut years in exile have taken their toll. The tender part of me is gone; kindness is a weakness I can no longer afford. To keep my sister safe and our dynasty alive, I must become a weapon — cold, ruthless, and unyielding." #NT!
