 tenet_lokiria_legacy_name:0 "Warriors of Lokiria"
 tenet_blood_sorcerer_desc:0 "Valyria has always been a nation of mighty sorcerers and scientists. Our glory is derived not from mere conquest, but from the domination of the feeble-minded. Reclaiming our nation's ancient glory means to rise above the lesser races of the world, in mind and soul."
 tenet_blood_sorcerer_name:0 "Legacy of the Sorcerer Kingdom"
 tenet_blood_purity_desc:0 "Valyrians are naturally superior to all other races. The blood of the dragon makes us closer to gods than men. We must not allow this sacred blessing to be diluted."

 tenet_aegon_rules_desc:0 "Aegon the Conqueror achieved what was deemed impossible. He unified the Seven Kingdoms and forged the greatest realm ever seen since the days of old Valyria.

 tenet_valar_morghulis_desc:0 "They may call us cruel, they may call us tyrants. They may even call us monsters, but is it not a reality of life that the strong triumph over the weak?

 tenet_good_buisness_name:0 "Just Good Business" 

 tenet_anti_magic_desc:0 "Never forget the pain and the horrors inflicted upon us by the Doom. The God's punishments are cruel but just. They struck those who, in their folly, sought to become their equal. We have sinned greatly, and we paid for it in fire and blood. May we never stray from the righteous path again. Magic in all its dreadful forms must be extinguished."
 tenet_anti_magic_name:0 "Never Forget"

 tenet_priest_council_desc:0 "While our kin bicker over their so-called 'orthodoxy', we have found that true wisdom can only be achieved through compromise.

 tenet_beauty_worship_desc:0 "There is no higher calling in life than the pursuit of beauty. Is not our beauty the most obvious proof of our sacred Valyrian lineage? Those among us blessed by the gods with the radiance of old Valyria deserve our reverence."

 tenet_valyrian_justice_name:0 "The Dragon's Law"

 tenet_dragon_union_desc:0 "Marriage is more than a mere formality or a political instrument. By performing this ancient ritual, two souls are bound together by fire and blood. This sacred union forms the bedrock of our faith and is something everyone should strive to defend."

 the_seven_targaryen:0 "Targaryen Faith of the Seven"
 the_seven_targaryen_desc:0 "When Aegon the Conqueror united the Seven Kingdoms, he and his descendants would adopt the Faith of the Seven. However, for several generations, the Targaryen way of worship differed from that of their Andalic subjects. Most noticeably, in the Targaryen's reverence for Dragons. It was only after the death of their dragons that this distinction became ultimately redundant."     
 the_seven_targaryen_adj:0 "Targaryen Faith of the Seven"
 the_seven_targaryen_adherent:0 "Targaryen Worshipper of the Seven"

 volantene_faith_adherent:0 "Volantene Worshipper of the Valyrian Gods"
 volantene_faith_adherent_plural:0 "Volantene Worshippers of the Valyrian Gods"
 volantene_faith_desc:0 "'Tala hen Perzys' or 'Daughter of the Flame' is the name used to refer to the worshippers of the Valyrian gods in Volantis. Since the Doom of Valyria, the faith has been steadily declining in favour of other cults or R'hllorism and other Free City cults. Today, it is only practised by a small number of staunch traditionalists among the Volantene nobility and in the more remote regions of the state. Although the followers of 'Tala he Perzys' like to claim they represent an unbroken strain of Valyrian religious orthodoxy, even their faith has been significantly influenced by other religions. Most notably, R'hllorism, as can be seen by the heavy emphasis the faith puts on fire rituals.

 covenant:0 "Smoking Sea Covenant" 
 covenant_adj:0 "The Covenant"
 covenant_adherent:0 "Sailor of the Lord of Light"
 covenant_adherent_plural:0 "Sailors of the Lord of Light"
 covenant_desc:0 "The Smoking Sea Covenant is a rather peculiar offshoot of R'hllorism. Originating in the vibrant and diverse port of Elyria, its followers seek to spread their lord's light from port to port until every ocean shines with his radiance...At least that is what they claim. Many observers have pointed out that their 'holy mission' seems to be nothing but an excuse for personal enrichment." 

 mantaryan:0 "Mantaryan"
 mantaryan_adj:0 "Mantaryan Trials"
 mantaryan_adherent:0 "Faithful Mantaryan"
 mantaryan_adherent_plural:0 "Faithful Mantaryans"
 mantaryan_desc:0 "After the Doom befell Valyria, many ancient cultural and religious beliefs were shattered. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Mantarys. For generations, the people of the Painted Mountains worshipped the dragons of Valyria as living gods. Following the Doom of Valyria and the near extinction of the dragons that came with it, the Mantari became a highly suspicious and isolationist people. While still worshipping the Dragon idols of their ancestors, they have developed a fierce hatred for magic and its practitioners, whom they deem responsible for the death of their gods. The Mantari believe that only by cleansing themselves of all forms of magic can they receive absolution in the next life, where they will be united with their fallen gods once again.    

 maegor_religion:0 "Maegorism"

 maegor:0 "Maegorism
 maegor_adj:0 "Maegorism"
 maegor_adherent:0 "Loyalist
 maegor_adherent_plural:0 "Loyalists"
 maegor_desc:0 "Although Maegor's rule ultimately ended in defeat, there were still those who remained loyal to his cause until the very end. In the years after, these loyalists began to organise in secret, forming covenants and lamenting the realm's fall from what they perceived to be Valyrian purity. Firmly convinced that Maegor's death was a conspiracy orchestrated by the Worshippers of the Seven, they seek to eradicate the Andalic gods tooth and nail, guiding all those of Valyrian blood back to 'Orthodoxy'. It is unclear if Maegor himself ever held such beliefs. However, his followers have proven to be quite adamant." 

imperial_valyrian:0 "Geron ēlyr Jaedārys"
imperial_valyrian_adj:0 "Imperial Doctrine"
imperial_valyrian_adherent:0 "Adherent of the Imperial Doctrine"
imperial_valyrian_adherent_plural:0 "Adherents of the Imperial Doctrine"
imperial_valyrian_desc:0 "'Geron ēlȳr Jaedārys' or 'Path of the First Emperor' is a faith which dates back to the last days of the old Freehold. Aurion, sick and tired of the endless bickering and infighting between the factions of the high court, sought to radically reform Valyria's political system. Claiming to have received a vision from the Gods, he advocated that the noblest and purest of all Dragonlords should rule Valyria by divine mandate as 'Jaedārys' or 'Emperor'. Although Aurion was able to gain a sizeable following, the Doom that soon followed and his disappearance shortly after had forced his remaining followers to reinterpret many of his teachings. What little remains of Aurion's following considers him to be the first Jaedārys, a martyr who died while trying to fulfil his sacred mission of renewing Valyria. Even to this day, there are still those who believe a new Jaedārys will one day rise to reclaim what was lost and fulfil Aurion's dream."

flames_of_passion:0 "Flames of Passion"
flames_of_passion_adj:0 "Flames of Passion"
flames_of_passion_adherent:0 "Follower of the Empress"
flames_of_passion_adherent_plural:0 "Followers of the Empress"
flames_of_passion_desc:0 "The Flames of Passion trace their origins back to a powerful faction within the ranks of the Valyrian Bloodmages who strongly emphasised the life-giving quality of Blood Magic over its more destructive qualities. After the Doom of Valyria, a small fraction of this group went east, where this already strongly female-centered group adapted many religious and cultural practices of the Court of Leng. Apart from its largely matriarchal structure, the Flames of Passion's most striking difference to the western Valyrian Cults is its staunch opposition to any form of slavery, believing it to be a practice beneath an otherwise morally and genetically pure Valyrian race."                

heavenly_wisdom:0 "Fourteen Heavenly Wisdoms"
heavenly_wisdom_adj:0 "Tolosi Mysticism"
heavenly_wisdom_adherent:0 "Tolosi Mysticist"

heavenly_wisdom_desc:0 "A pragmatic faith that originated in Tolos at the crossroads between three worlds. Fourteen Heavenly Wisdoms describes a wide variety of Valyrian beliefs and practices held together mainly by an overarching priesthood which acts as mediator in religious and worldly matters."

fair_lady:0 "Cult of Pure Beauty"
fair_lady_adj:0 "Pure Beauty"
fair_lady_adherent:0 "Worshipper of the Pure Beauty"
fair_lady_adherent_plural:0 "Worshippers of the Pure Beauty" 
fair_lady_desc:0 "The Cult of Pure Beauty is one of the oldest cults in the Free Cities. While originally hailing from some of the more hedonistic factions within the Valyrian court, it has evolved quite a bit since those days. At its core, it remains a very Valyrian faith, with its heavy emphasis on blood purity and proper lineage. The most striking difference, however, is the cult's openly matriarchal structure, founded in the belief that only women can give birth to children of pure Valyrian blood and beauty."
