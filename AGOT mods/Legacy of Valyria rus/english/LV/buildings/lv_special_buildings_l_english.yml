Though the rituals have long since faded into history, their dark legacy endures, making the citadel not only a near-impenetrable stronghold, but also a haunting symbol of absolute power.\n\nAt its heart, The Red Tower pierces the sky, its presence casting a long shadow over the city, a constant reminder of the archon's authority. The lower walls and courtyard remain slick with blood, not only from the rituals of the past but from the countless executions, betrayals, and brutal conflicts that have played out upon its stones. The blood of rebels, conspirators, and enemies of the state has seeped into its foundations, ensuring that fear is woven into the very fabric of the fortress.\n\nIt is whispered that within these walls, the Red Death first took root, a curse that once ravaged Gogossos, leaving entire districts drowning in blood and suffering. Though the disease has long faded into history, some say the citadel still remembers, that the ghosts of the dying linger in its deepest chambers, whispering to those who listen.\n\nA place of iron rule and legend, the Red Citadel is more than just a fortress—it is the unyielding core of Gogossos, a place where power is absolute, mercy is scarce, and rebellion is crushed before it can begin."
