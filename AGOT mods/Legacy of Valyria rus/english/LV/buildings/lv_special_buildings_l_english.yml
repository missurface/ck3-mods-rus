Twisting hedges, grown wild and unnatural, form an intricate labyrinth, their paths shifting and closing like living things, leading the unwary deeper into confusion. Among the tangled greenery lurk plants of impossible colors and unnatural shapes, their beauty masking deadly intent. Some release spores that choke the lungs, others secrete toxins that blister the skin, and a few move with unsettling purpose, waiting for prey to draw too close.\n\nLegends whisper that something—perhaps the remnants of a forgotten sorcery, or the lingering presence of whatever force once ruled here—keeps the flora thriving in ways that defy nature. The ruins remain untouched, not because they are forgotten, but because they are feared.
