  lv_great_project.0001.t:0 "Breaking the Silence: [sub_region.GetName]"
  lv_great_project.0001.desc:0 "The first shovel strike is a sound that was not meant to be heard in this desolate place. The rehabilitation efforts in [sub_region.GetName] have begun, an act of blasphemy against the Doom and the silence it imposes.\n\nYou have chosen your foothold for this monumental project—a patch of ruined, black soil beside a half-collapsed wall, perhaps once a villa or a minor tower. As your laborers begin to clear the worst of the ash and twisted debris, the land itself seems to sigh in refusal. The air grows heavier, the heat more intense.\n\nMagic, ancient and untamed, sleeps just beneath the surface. It is not a force you can command yet, but a poison that resists the very concept of order. The seeds you try to sow shrivel into charcoal flakes. The water you draw from a nearby, lukewarm spring tastes of sulfur and forgotten spells. Every hour of work achieves only a few moments of unstable progress. The Doom has not left; it has simply gone still, waiting for an upstart to remind it that it still reigns."
  lv_great_project.0001.desc.attempted:0 "The second, or perhaps the hundredth, shovel strike is not a new sound here—it is a cry of defiance against the Doom. The rehabilitation of [sub_region.GetName] is not a beginning, but a grueling continuation of what had already been done.\n\nYou survey the current foothold. Others before you, or your own earlier endeavors, have left scars of effort in Valyria already: lines of cleared ash that have already begun to blur, stacks of salvaged stone, and the ghostly remnants of failed gardens or collapsed foundations.\n\nYour laborers move with a hardened caution. They know the rhythm of this work—the cycle of false starts and sudden, violent reversals. The land no longer sighs in surprised refusal; now, it feels like it scoffs at your persistence. The ancient, untamed magic here has learned to expect intrusion. It has developed an immunity to minor attempts at order. The faint taste of sulfur in the water and the way the air presses down on the site are familiar hazards, not surprises.\n\nEchoes of the Doom remind you that you are not fighting an aftermath, but a living scar. This attempt, however, carries the weight of all that came before. If you can build upon those fragile, failed foundations, you might finally prove that the Doom does not get the final word on [sub_region.GetName]."
  lv_great_project.0001.desc.succeeded:0 "This shovel strike echoes with the weight of both ruin and resurrection. The ground beneath [sub_region.GetName] is still poisoned, but now you know the poison can be countered. The formula has been cracked before; now, you must follow it once more.\n\nYou have chosen your foothold, not entirely in the dark, but in the shadow of a miracle. Your laborers can look to the horizon of Valyria and know there is proof somewhere within these haunted lands—the distant, shimmering vision of a successfully reclaimed region where walls stand straight, where smoke rises from cookfires instead of sulfur vents, and where green life asserts itself. That knowledge is the true foundation of this new effort.\n\nBut inspiration offers little comfort against the immediate reality. As your crew begins to clear the familiar twisted stone and choking ash, the air remains thick and hostile. The magical resistance here is stubborn, perhaps unique to [sub_region.GetName], fighting against the established pattern of healing. The first seeds still struggle, and the local water remains harsh, as if the Doom itself refuses to admit defeat in this specific territory.\n\nThis is a monumental test. The way has been shown, but the path is not easy. You are not fighting against universal despair, but against the stubborn, final stand of annihilation. Every ounce of progress you gain here is a hard-won victory that expands the miracle, pushing the borders of life further into the heart of the dead empire."

  lv_great_project.0003.desc:0 "Generations will tell of this day. The long night of the Doom has a new dawn, and it begins over in [sub_region.GetName].\n\nYou stand upon the highest point of the newly rehabilitated region and look out across the new walls and the first stable roads. This is the first true city of life to rise in the heart of Valyria since it was shattered by the Doom. The cost was high, the setbacks crushing, but the result is a triumph that defies history.\n\nThe ring of the smith's hammer, the cries of local traders, the murmur of stable conversation. All these are the new sounds that drown out the whispers of the dead. Maesters in the Citadel to the sorcerers of Asshai will tell of this day until possibly the end of all days.\n\nYet, as you look toward the steaming, chaotic wilderness beyond your borders, you feel a profound sense of isolation. You have won a battle, but the war for Valyria—the struggle to reclaim every ruined inch—has only just begun. The legacy of Valyria now rests on the shoulders of the living."

A brilliant, new stretch of clear sky now opens over [sub_region.GetName].\n\nYou stand upon the highest point of the newly rehabilitated region and look out across the new walls and the stable roads. This region is a powerful new anchor in the dead heart of Valyria, adding its strength to the realm of the living. The cost was crushing, the setbacks legion, but the result is a triumph that exponentially expands the great work.\n\nThe ring of the smith's hammer, the cries of local traders, the murmur of stable conversation. All these are the triumphant sounds that now swell the chorus of life.\n\nYet, as you look toward the steaming, chaotic wilderness beyond your borders, you feel the profound weight of the task ahead. You have not finished the war, but you have successfully wrested another irreplaceable prize from the clutches of annihilation. The fight for Valyria continues, but with the securing of [sub_region.GetName], the ultimate victory of the living feels closer than ever. The legacy of Valyria rests, more securely than before, on the shoulders of the living."

  lv_great_project.0004.desc:0 "Across the known world—from the shores of Westeros to the spice markets of Qarth, from the towers of the Citadel to the temples of Yi Ti—a single, staggering truth is being whispered, shouted, and written down: Valyria lives again.\n\nAfter the destruction brought for by the Doom, the impossible has been achieved. The region of [sub_region.GetName] has been reclaimed, stabilized, and secured by the unwavering will of [founder.GetName] and the workers who dared the Doom. The air here, once poison, is now breathed by the living. The soil, once cursed, now answers to the plow.\n\nThe land of [sub_region.GetName], once poisoned and haunted by the ghosts of the smothered Freehold, now stands as proof of the ultimate potential of restoration. [founder.GetName] has challenged the very curse that consumed the greatest empire in history, and has won the first, vital victory.\n\nLet all cities and kingdoms know: The terror remains, the perils are still vast, and the smoking shadow of the Doom still encompasses the continent. But a light has been lit that no ash can extinguish. The road back to Valyria is no longer barred by total, desolate silence. The old world is shaking, and the age of the long, slow return has begun."

  lv_great_project.0006.desc:0 "The earth yielded a treasure beyond measure. The survey team has cracked a tomb—or perhaps, a forgotten, subterranean vault—untouched since the Doom fell upon Valyria.\n\nThe breakthrough came beneath the deepest layer of solidified ash: a perfectly sealed chamber, its entrance masked by a collapsed ceiling of fused dragonstone. Inside, the world of Old Valyria remained frozen. Great chests of gold and silver coins, uncorrupted by time, lay stacked against walls etched with Valyrian text.\n\nBut the true significance of the find lies deeper. Beyond the main treasury hall, the survey team found evidence of a separate, highly-secured inner sanctum. This smaller, tightly sealed chamber was clearly designed to house items of extreme rarity: objects that could rival the worth of entire kingdoms.\n\nYour archaeologists are now working to carefully crack the ancient seals guarding this inner room. The gold is secured, the vault is opened, and now you await the final report: Did the centuries of silence preserve the artifacts within... or did the Doom claim them, leaving only the memory of their power?"
