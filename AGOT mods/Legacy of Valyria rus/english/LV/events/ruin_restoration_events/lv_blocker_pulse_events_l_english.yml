  # Mines Pulse
  lv_mines_pulse.0001.t:0 "Whispers Beneath [mines_province.GetNameNoTooltip]"
  lv_mines_pulse.0001.desc:0 "At night, the winds carry strange sounds from the old Valyrian mines — low rumbles, like stone grinding against stone, followed by a hiss that burns the ear. The locals claim it is just the air shifting through broken tunnels, but your scouts speak of worse.\n\nOne swore he saw molten claw-marks etched along a collapsed shaft. Another, pale with fear, swore he heard something breathing down in the dark. The miners refuse to return. Even beasts won’t stray near the mouth of the pit.\n\nSomething stirs beneath [mines_province.GetName]. And whatever it is, it remembers the taste of fire and flesh."
  lv_mines_pulse.0001.a:0 "We will remain vigilant... and pray the wyrms stay buried."
  lv_mines_pulse.0001.a.tt:0 "The sounds are hushed eventually, and the mines are left undisturbed for now."
  lv_mines_pulse.0001.a.tt.firewyrm:0 "Something emerges from the mines."

  # Noxious Gases Pulse
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0001.t:0 "When the Air Turns Heavy"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0001.desc:0 "The winds have shifted. What was once a drifting haze has thickened into a pallid, choking fog that clings to every stone and leaf. Across [noxious_gases_province.GetName]’s scarred lowlands, the air grows heavy with the acrid bite of sulfur and the slow-burning reek of ruin.\n\nAnimals flee the valleys. Men cough blood before collapsing to their knees. Even fire burns pale in the mist, as though afraid to breathe. Those who dwell near the volcanic veins say this always happens when the earth groans low — a foul season, when the land exhales poison instead of breath.\n\nSome whisper of illness spreading. Others speak of omens. But most simply wrap cloth around their mouths and hope to see another dawn."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0001.a:0 "We can only endure — and pray it passes swiftly."
  
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t:0 "A Breath Between Storms"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc:0 "For the first time in weeks, the wind shifts clean from the sea. The acrid fog thins, retreating from the lowlands like a sullen tide. Birds return to the trees. A child laughs without coughing. Fires burn true and bright once more.\n\nThe poison hasn’t vanished, only receded — like a beast slinking back into its den. Yet in this moment, there is clarity. The mountains still fume in the distance, but the skies above are clear enough to see stars.\n\nIt is not healing. It is not salvation. But it is a breath, however brief."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a:0 "We’ll take what mercy the land allows."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt:0 "The toxic fumes in [noxious_gases_province.GetName] disperse, and the land breathes again."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.normal_1:0 "The Winds Turn Kindly"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.normal_1:0 "A rare shift in the wind carries the choking fumes out to sea. Though the air still smells faintly of brimstone, and ash continues to fall like dust from a forgotten brazier, the suffocating haze has lifted.\n\nIn the skeletal remains of stone streets, voices carry further. Campfires burn without coughing fits. For the first time in weeks, the land does not feel like it’s trying to kill you."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.normal_1:0 "We will take what mercy we can, even here."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.normal_1:0 "The air in [noxious_gases_province.GetName] turns a little more tolerable."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.normal_2:0 "Clear Skies, For Now"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.normal_2:0 "The skies over [noxious_gases_province.GetName] remain grey — not with cloud, but with ash suspended eternally in the air. Yet today, the low fumes have thinned, and one can walk the cracked avenues of the ruins without burning lungs or watering eyes.\n\nIt is not clean, not truly. But it is survivable. And that alone is enough to stir cautious optimism."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.normal_2:0 "A bitter breath is better than none."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.normal_2:0 "Work continues as the settlers in [noxious_gases_province.GetName] can breathe a little better again."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.normal_3:0 "A Moment to Breathe"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.normal_3:0 "The mists that once curled tight around every broken column and obsidian ridge have drawn back. Pale sunlight struggles through a ceiling of volcanic soot, casting wan light across blackened stone.\n\nPaths lost to fume and shadow now briefly stand revealed. The air is still warm, still acrid — but one can walk without gagging, and that is enough to matter."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.normal_3:0 "Even in ash, a path may be cleared."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.normal_3:0 "[noxious_gases_province.GetName] breathes a sigh of relief long missed."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.normal_4:0 "Scoured by Rain"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.normal_4:0 "[noxious_gases_province.GetName]’s ash-heavy sky wept for days — thick, gritty rain that turned roads into black slurry and soaked even the most weathered cloaks. But when the storm passed, it took with it the worst of the poison hanging low in the air.\n\nThe fumes have thinned, though the scent of sulphur and smoke remains, woven into every stone. Still, for once, breath does not burn."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.normal_4:0 "The rain cleans nothing, but it grants a reprieve."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.normal_4:0 "The fumes have been washed away, for a time."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.normal_5:0 "The Ash Settles"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.normal_5:0 "For a time, the fume-choked winds grow still. The air remains heavy and laced with the bitter tang of old fire, but the rolling clouds of smoke have ebbed. Across the ruined hills and broken towers, ash lies undisturbed — thick as snow, silent as a crypt.\n\nIt is not peace, only pause. But under [noxious_gases_province.GetName]’s bruised sky, that is as close as one can hope for."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.normal_5:0 "The land exhales, but it does not sleep."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.normal_5:0 "With the fumes thinning, the settlement of [noxious_gases_province.GetName] had been spared."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.spooky_1:0 "Something in the Mist"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.spooky_1:0 "The fumes did not merely grow thicker — they changed. Not in color or smell, but in presence. The fog clings longer than it should, curling in strange, deliberate ways. A scout swears he saw shadows moving inside it — not men, nor beasts, but something watching.\n\nAt dusk, the mist hums with a sound like whispered breath. Fires gutter when placed near it. Old runes, long thought meaningless, begin to glow faintly on sunken stones.\n\nSome say the gases stir old magics buried deep beneath Valyria — powers bound in smoke and bone. Others say it is simply the land remembering what it once was: not just a realm of fire, but of sorcery.\n\nFew sleep easily. Fewer dare speak of what they saw."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.spooky_1:0 "Best not to dwell on what cannot be explained."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.spooky_1:0 "The toxic fumes in [noxious_gases_province.GetName] disperse regardless."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.spooky_2:0 "Echoes on the Wind"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.spooky_2:0 "The fog rolls in thicker than before, and with it come sounds no living throat should make — low moans, distant howls, the clatter of unseen hooves across stone. Some claim it’s the wind twisting through ruined halls, but others swear they heard voices speaking in a tongue long dead.\n\nEach night, the sounds grow bolder. Not closer — just louder. As though whatever makes them wants to be heard."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.spooky_2:0 "The land remembers things we were not meant to know."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.spooky_2:0 "[noxious_gases_province.GetName] remained restless for a time, but the fumes eventually dispersed."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.spooky_3:0 "Dead Men Breathing"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.spooky_3:0 "A band of travelers passes through the mist and emerges pale, trembling... and strangely silent. Their skin bears no wounds, yet their eyes are glassy and unfocused, and their mouths twitch with words they cannot speak.\n\nThey do not respond when spoken to. They simply breathe — slow, rasping inhalations, over and over. You order them watched, but some guards refuse to go near them.\n\nWhatever happened in that fog, part of it stayed with them."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.spooky_3:0 "Keep them comfortable... and contained."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.spooky_3:0 "Whatever happened to these men remained a mystery, but eventually the fog over [noxious_gases_province.GetName] thinned to what it was before."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.spooky_4:0 "The Color Beneath"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.spooky_4:0 "For a single hour, the fog glows faintly green — not vibrant, but enough to cast ghostly light across the shattered ground. Beneath its glow, old glyphs emerge on ancient stonework, patterns unseen for centuries.\n\nSome claim it is a natural reaction. Others won’t speak of it at all. The glow fades before dawn, leaving only silence and smoke."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.spooky_4:0 "Perhaps it was never meant to be seen by sunlight."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.spooky_4:0 "Soon enough, the air in [noxious_gases_province.GetName] returned to how it used to be."

  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.t.spooky_5:0 "Ash in the Blood"
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.desc.spooky_5:0 "Several laborers working near the fumes develop strange afflictions: skin that grays and flakes like scorched parchment, and veins that pulse faintly as though glowing beneath. None show signs of illness or pain — but none look quite human anymore.\n\nA healer insists it’s merely chemical exposure. Another claims it’s a curse. And one old woman, half-mad, swears she saw such marks on the old dragonlords, just before the Doom."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.spooky_5:0 "Burn the bodies. Burn the tools. Speak of this to no one."
  lv_noxious_gases_pulse.0002.a.tt.spooky_5:0 "Eventually, the fumes leave [noxious_gases_province.GetName]."
