  trait_silent_monster:0 "Silent Monster"
  trait_silent_monster_desc:0 "A monster born of corrupted magics, these vile creatures are mere shadows of what they once were—if they were ever truly human at all. Twisted beyond recognition, their forms are warped by dark sorcery, their minds lost to the madness that fuels them.\n\nThey are nothing more than beasts now, driven by an insatiable hunger for destruction. Their bodies refuse to wither, their flesh no longer bound by the laws of life and death. Immortal, relentless, and terrifyingly deadly in combat, they are a nightmare given form—unstoppable unless met with forces just as powerful as the dark magic that created them"

  trait_demon_trait:0 "Demon"
  trait_demon_trait_desc:0 "A demon most foul, these wretched beings are birthed from the very depths of the earth, where fire and magic fuse in a chaotic blend of raw, unholy power. Forged in darkness, they rise from molten caverns, their twisted forms sculpted by hatred and cursed flame.\n\nThey despise all living things, seeing them as nothing more than prey to be torn apart in their eternal wrath. Once roused from their ancient slumber, there is no reasoning, no mercy—only carnage. They will not stop, will not tire, until their bloodlust is sated and the world is left in ruin"
