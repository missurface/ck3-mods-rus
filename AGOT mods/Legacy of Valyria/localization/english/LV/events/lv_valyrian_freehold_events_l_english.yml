  lv_valyrian_freehold.0001.desc:0 "The nightmare of the Doom is shattered. Valyria—the cradle of magic, the seat of dragons, the heart of the world—is whole again.\n\nToday, the shattered land of Valyria stands as one, and the great cities, violently silenced by the Fourteen Flames, echo once more with the roar of life. The fires that destroyed this empire have been quelled, and the true, brilliant light of the Valyrian Freehold shines once more across the Smoking Sea.\n\nYou stand at the nexus of history. The people look to you not as their ruler, but as the architect of the impossible—the one who defied the Doom and won. Every corner of the reborn Freehold pulses with a renewed vigor that no other kingdom can hope to rival.\n\nLet the other powers of the world tremble. The shadow of the Doom is lifted, and in its place the fire of Valyria burns brighter than it ever has. The might of Old Valyria is yours to command. The Age of the Freehold begins now."

The impossible has come to pass: the Doom has been defied, and the Valyrian Freehold has been declared restored.\n\nThe silence that held the peninsula since the Doom is broken. Where once there was only death and ruin, now stands a unified power, bound together not just by law, but by the blazing will of the [restorer.GetTitleTierName]. The Fourteen Flames burn once more for a living master.\n\nA colossal shadow now falls across the known world. From the Sunset Kingdoms to the Golden Empire of Yi Ti, kings and emperors look to the sky with newfound fear. The world of men is about to be tested like never before, for the Age of the Freehold has come again.""

  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.intro:0 "The banners of the Freehold fly once more over lands that thought themselves free. Where our ancestors once ruled by right of blood and fire, we now return to claim our inheritance. The long silence is over, and the glory of this reclamation belongs solely to me.\n\n"
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.elyria:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] sat on the edge of the apocalypse and survived, only to forget its masters in the confusion that followed.\n\nOnce, this wealthy island knew no self-rule, governed only by men and women sent from the heartland to enforce our will. In our absence, they turned their faces east toward the Harpy and the Ghiscari, seeking coin over loyalty. That era of independence is ended. The ties to Slaver's Bay are severed, and [county.GetNameNoTier] shall once again serve as the gateway to the Lands of the Long Summer, governed as it was always meant to be: by Valyria."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.mantarys:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the so-called city of monsters, now cowers before the true masters of the Demon Road.\n\nWhile the Doom swallowed the peninsula, its fallout merely twisted this city, leaving its inhabitants misshapen and malformed—a living mockery of Valyrian beauty. For centuries, they have frightened travelers and guarded the northern approach with a sinister reputation.\n\nBut fear holds no sway over those who have conquered the Doom itself. The twisted lords of [county.GetNameNoTier] have surrendered. Their monstrous strength shall no longer serve only themselves; it shall be harnessed, as it was in the days of old, to serve the will of the Freehold."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.tolos:0 "The Black Cliffs of [county.GetNameNoTier] have long looked out over Slaver's Bay, turning a blind eye to the west. Like its neighbors, [county.GetNameNoTier] forgot its origins in the aftermath of the Doom, courting the favor of the Ghiscari and the Harpy.\n\nBut the Dragon does not forget what belongs to it. We have not come for their trade, but for their aim. The famed slingers of [county.GetNameNoTier], whose soft lead balls can shatter bone through mail, are a weapon forged under our shadow long ago. No longer will they serve as mercenaries for the highest bidder in the Bay; they are returned to the imperial arsenal, ready to rain death upon the enemies of the Freehold."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.volantis:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the First Daughter, has finally been brought to heel.\n\nFor centuries, the Old Blood dwelling behind the Black Walls grew fat on arrogance, styling themselves the successors to our glory. They contributed much to the chaos of the Century of Blood, attempting to claim a mantle that was too heavy for them to carry, before retreating into the stagnation of their Elephants.\n\nThey forgot that they were founded not as an empire, but as a garrison. The Black Walls were raised to protect the borders of the Freehold, not to hide pretenders. Today, the natural order is restored. The Tigers are toothless, the Elephants have yielded, and the Dragon has returned to remind the First Daughter that her only true duty is to obey."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.tyrosh:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] is a city of garish colors, but beneath the dye lies a history of blackest treachery.\n\nIt began as a bleak outpost to hold the Stepstones, rising to wealth only because our ancestors favored their unique pigments. Yet, when the Doom fell, the Tyroshi repaid our patronage with murder. They slaughtered the surviving dragonlords and their mounts in a fit of panic and greed, hoping to erase their servitude.\n\nWe have not forgotten. The city is reclaimed, and the debt is called in. The Stepstones are once again under our watch, and the dyemakers of [county.GetNameNoTier] have learned that while paint can cover a wall, it cannot hide them from the Dragon's justice."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.lys:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] is known as the Lovely, and for good reason. Here, more than anywhere else in the world, the blood of the Freehold runs strong. Even the beggars in the streets wear the silver hair and violet eyes of the dragonlords, living ghosts of the glory we lost.\n\nBut a Valyrian face does not hide a traitor's heart. When the Doom struck, the Lyseni turned on the dragons and riders who sought refuge in their palm-shaded gardens, slaughtering them in a panic to ensure their own survival.\n\nWe have returned to correct that mistake. The pleasure gardens of the empire are ours once more, and the Lyseni—beautiful, treacherous, and proud—have been reminded that while they may share our blood, they do not share our power."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.myr:0 "Walled [county.GetNameNoTier] stands where the ancient Dragonroads meet the sea, a city built by Valyrian adventurers upon the broken stones of the Andals.\n\nFor years, this city has defined itself by coin and craft, bleeding itself dry in the endless, petty wars for the Disputed Lands. They believed their walls, their wealth, and their Red God could protect them from the turning of the wheel. They were wrong.\n\nThe dispute is ended. The artisans of [county.GetNameNoTier]—masters of clear glass, intricate lace, and complex mechanisms—are the finest in the world. Their talents are too valuable to be wasted on mercantile feuds. The workshops of [county.GetNameNoTier] now belong to the Freehold, and their fires burn for us."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.pentos:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] has always been a city of compromise, where the blood of the Dragon was allowed to thin and mingle with the Andals. For too long, the Magisters have ruled from the shadows, hiding behind the gilded cage of their ceremonial Prince.\n\nBy their own laws, the Prince’s throat must be slit when a war is lost to appease the gods. But the gods of [county.GetNameNoTier] are silent before us. We have no need for the blood of a puppet. It is the Magisters—the cheese-mongers and spice-traders who thought they could buy the world—who will now learn the true cost of power. The sham of the Prince is ended, and the reality of the Dragon has begun."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.chroyane:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] lies shrouded in the mists of the Sorrows, a monument to the last time a power dared to truly challenge the Freehold.\n\nIt was here that Prince Garin was hung in a golden cage to watch his Festival City burn, and here that he called upon the River Mother to drown our ancestors in a curse of fog and greyscale. For a thousand years, the Stone Men and their Shrouded Lord have ruled these ruins, protected by the breath of the dead.\n\nBut the Dragon does not fear the damp. We have returned to finish the war. The Greyscale shall be purged with dragonflame, the mists burned away by the heat of our return. The Rhoyne belongs to us now, and [county.GetNameNoTier] serves as a grim reminder: water may drown a man, but fire consumes a civilization."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.ny_sar:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] was once a city of fountains and song, the seat of the Warrior-Princess Nymeria. But songs die quickly when the sky fills with ash.\n\nUnlike the fool Garin, Nymeria knew better than to face the Dragonlords in the open. She stripped this city bare and fled with her Ten Thousand Ships, denying our ancestors the slaves that were their due. She left behind only a shell—a colossal palace of pink and green marble, now shattered and silent.\n\nWe have returned to claim the ruins she abandoned. The fountains are dry, the singers are gone, and the Rhoyne flows quietly past the wreckage. Let this broken city stand as proof: you may run to the ends of the earth, but you can never truly outrun the Dragon."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.meereen:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the greatest of the Slaver Cities, has long grown fat on the conceit that the Old Empire of Ghis could rise again. The Great Masters sit atop their pyramids, speaking a mongrel dialect of our own tongue, believing themselves the lords of the world.\n\nThey forget their history. Five times the Harpy flew against the Dragon, and five times she was cast down. We learned the art of the chain from their ancestors, only to bind them with it.\n\nToday, the Great Pyramid is cleansed. The Harpy is toppled, her bronzed wings shattered upon the stones. The Masters have learned the final lesson of their trade: there are those who hold the whip, and those who feel it. [county.GetNameNoTier] is a colony once more."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.yunkai:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the Yellow City, reeks of perfume and decay. The so-called 'Wise Masters' have long grown rich training slaves for the bedchamber, hiding behind high walls and styling their home the 'Queen of Cities.'\n\nBut a queen bows to a Dragon. The Ghiscari Harpy of [county.GetNameNoTier]—with her scorpion’s tail and iron collar—has been declawed.\n\nThe Wise Masters have finally learned the limits of their wisdom. Their training pits, their pleasure houses, and their people are no longer their own. We learned the trade of human bondage from their ancestors, and now we return to remind them that while they may trade in flesh, we trade in fire."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.astapor:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the Red City, is built on an old, grim truth: bricks and blood. For many years, the Good Masters have grown rich breaking men into the perfect weapon—the Unsullied.\n\nThey boast of the absolute discipline of their Unsullied, styling themselves the greatest slavers in the world. But they are merely the leftovers of Old Ghis, a civilization we crushed five times over.\n\nThe training plazas are silent now, awaiting new orders. The Harpy’s chain has been seized. No longer will the Unsullied be sold as mercenaries to the highest bidder; the greatest infantry in the world has been claimed for the imperial army. The Good Masters have been reminded that while they may break men, only the Dragon breaks empires."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.new_ghis:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] rises from the Gulf of Grief, a brazen attempt to resurrect a corpse we buried five thousand years ago.\n\nWhile the other Slaver Cities rotted in stagnation, [county.GetNameNoTier] sought to recreate the military might of the Old Empire. They drilled their Iron Legions in the lockstep of the past—free men, not slaves, fighting with the discipline of the ancients.\n\nBut if the true Old Empire could not stand against the Dragon at the height of its power, what hope did this pale imitation have? Their legions have shattered against our lines. We have extinguished this spark of Ghiscari revival before it could become a flame. There will be no Sixth Ghiscari War; [county.GetNameNoTier] is ours."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.old_ghis:0 "The wind over [county.GetNameNoTier] tastes of salt, sulfur, and ancient dust. Here lies the corpse of the Old Empire, the only power that ever truly challenged the rising Dragon.\n\nFive times the Harpy flew against us, and five times she fell. Five thousand years ago, our ancestors shattered their lockstep legions, pulled down their brick walls, and sowed their fields with skulls so that nothing would ever grow here again.\n\nThey succeeded. Unlike Valyria, which has risen from the ashes of the Doom, [county.GetNameNoTier] remains in its grave. We raise our banners over these ruins not to honor their legacy, but to stand upon the tomb of the Old Empire of Ghis and remind the world: The Dragon conquers death; the Harpy merely feeds on it."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.gogossos:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier] stands on the Isle of Tears as a monument to the darkest impulses of our ancestors. Once a Ghiscari outpost, we transformed it into the oubliette of the Freehold—a pit where the worst criminals and darkest sorcerers were sent to be forgotten.\n\nIn the silence following the Doom, the inmates took over the asylum. They practiced blood magic and flesh-crafting that defied nature, breeding beasts with men and daring to style their abomination the 'Tenth Free City.'\n\nThat delusion is ended. A prison is not a city. We have returned to take back the keys. The flesh-pits and sorcerous vaults now answer to us, and the twisted horrors of [county.GetNameNoTier] will no longer run wild; they are a dark resource, returned to the lock and key of the Dragon."
  lv_valyrian_freehold.0100.desc.braavos:0 "[county.GetNameNoTier], the Bastard Daughter, the Secret City. For centuries, they cowered in this lagoon, a civilization built by stolen property upon a foundation of fog and fear.\n\nThe Moonsingers promised them a sanctuary where the Dragon could not find them. They lied. The Titan of Braavos may stand tall, but he is made of stone and bronze; he cannot stand against flesh and fire.\n\nToday, the First Law is repealed. The Iron Bank has been seized, its vaults broken open to repay the debt of the ships stolen from our ancestors a thousand years ago. The runaways have been found, the masquerade is over, and the Bastard Daughter has been dragged out of the shadows to kneel before her rightful masters."
