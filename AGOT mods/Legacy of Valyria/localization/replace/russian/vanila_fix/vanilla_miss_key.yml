 building_elyria_great_port_02_desc: "The Great Port of Elyria is an immense dockyard built during the days of the [valyrian_freehold_short|E]. Elyria's strategic position in the Bay of Slaves provides this small island with significant traffic of ships, trade, and slaves, which this massive port can accommodate. After the collapse of the [valyrian_freehold_short|E], this port captured a significant portion of the Bay of Slaves' trade, becoming the envy of the region and its surroundings."
