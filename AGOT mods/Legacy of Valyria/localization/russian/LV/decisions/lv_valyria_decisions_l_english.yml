  lv_restore_valyrian_freehold_decision_desc:0 "At its peak, the Valyrian Freehold stood unopposed as the greatest and dominant civilization of its time, best known for its ability to command countless dragons in its name during times of war. So great was this military and cultural power that only the cataclysm of the Doom was enough to end its five-thousand-year rule over Essos. All that remained of this great civilization were the smoldering spires of the great dragonlords and haunted, ash-covered lands partially devoured by the Smoking Sea.\n\nIf the heartland of Valyria could be reclaimed, along with a good amount of its former territories, no one can dispute my claim and authority as being the true and rightful ruler of the Valyrian Freehold."
