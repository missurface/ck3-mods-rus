 mde_filler_dragon.0002.desc: "As my [GetCourtPositionType('wet_nurse_court_position').GetName()] [nursemaid.GetFirstName] #italic bursts #!into my room, a wave of worry; and perhaps a hint of annoyance, washes over me. Raising children, even with attendants, has never been an easy task.\n\nTrailing behind [nursemaid.GetFirstName] comes [older_child.GetFirstName] and [younger_child.GetFirstName], and while [nursemaid.GetSheHe] tries to explain the prank [older_child.GetFirstName] has pulled, the children break into a loud shouting match.\n\nApparently, [older_child.GetFirstName] gifted [younger_child.GetFirstName] a false dragon egg as a jest, and now the joke is the talk of every child in the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]."

 mde_filler_dragon.0004.desc: "Heard across [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], a furious wail suddenly pierces the air, echoing deeply from the nursery.\n\nRushing toward it, I find young [child.GetFirstName] red-faced, pointing accusingly at his cradle [egg_child.GetName]. Tears stain his cheeks as he cries, #italic "I don't want!

Do I indulge this draconic demand, or teach a lesson in gratitude?"
 mde_filler_dragon.0004.a: "Indulge [child.GetHerHim]."
 mde_filler_dragon.0004.b: "Take back the egg."

The smallfolk have gotten a wild idea: that the #bold body#! of a single dragon could feed them forever. Whispers turn to talk, and talk into dangerous hope.

 mde_filler_dragon.0010.c: "Let's show them what dragons #bold really#! are."

 mde_filler_dragon.0011.desc: "At yet another council meeting, good news finally reaches me; the ridiculous notion that a dragon corpse could feed the smallfolk forever has all but faded from the talk on the street.\n\nIt seems the growing population of #italic rats; and other vile, crawling things,#! has provided just enough sustenance to quiet their hunger and keep more maniacal thoughts at bay.\n\nRegardless, there are always more pressing matters to attend to."

 mde_filler_dragon.0012.desc: "While I am deep in discussion with my councilors, my [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillorPosition( 'councillor_castellan' ).GetPositionName] bursts into the chamber. Clear panic shows on [hand.GetHerHis] face, as he tries to explain the situation to us.\n\nThe smallfolk have actually had the audacity to #bold DARE#! assault my property! A roaring mass of ravenous, ungrateful, and traitorous; barely human, has stormed the Dragonpit!\n\nThough the Dragonkeepers, guards, and even the dragons themselves fought back, and the ground is littered with the bodies of the fallen... reports say that #color_red [dead_dragon.GetName]#! has been slaughtered.\n\nThe surviving mass used tools, weapons, anything they could find to pry beneath its sacred scales."
 mde_filler_dragon.0012.a: "The smallfolk will suffer for this!"

 mde_filler_dragon.0020.desc: "#italic "How!"#! I demand. #x "HOW!"#! I roar.\n\nNo one answers. The Maesters fumble with scrolls and mutter nonsense.

 mde_filler_dragon.0024.t: "Unperturbed Presence"
 mde_filler_dragon.0024.desc: "Feeding time is usually a controlled chaos, with dragonkeepers warily distributing meat while keeping a safe distance.\n\nYet, [ridden_dragon.GetName] displayed remarkable composure. It waited patiently for its share, allowing keepers to move around it with minimal signs of agitation.\n\nAt one point, a keeper stumbled, sending a bucket clattering to the ground.

 mde_filler_dragon.0026.desc: "Today's offering was goat, usually a favourite amongst the young dragons. Yet, [ridden_dragon.GetName] merely sniffed at the carcass before turning away, showing no interest.\n\nYesterday, it devoured the offered pig readily enough.\n\nThe feeders observed this pattern repeating: the dragon showed distinct preferences, often refusing perfectly good meat if it wasn't to its liking.\n\nWhile frustrating for the feeders, this discerning palate inadvertently led to less consumption, marking [ridden_dragon.GetName] as unusually restrained in its needs."
 mde_filler_dragon.0026.a: "Fine, feed it what it eats."
 mde_filler_dragon.0026.b: "Starve it, until it eats everything again."
