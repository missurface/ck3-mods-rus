 cm_harrenhal.0001.t:0 "Constructing The Largest Castle In Westeros"
 cm_harrenhal.0001.desc:0 "I stand with [councillor.GetName] before me, quill in [councillor.GetHerHis] hand writing down everything I desire in my new keep. It had been a few days of this, [councillor.GetHerHim] meeting me in the council chambers and me giving every detail that came into my mind for what will come to be the grandest castle in all of Westeros.\n\n"I want it to have five towers, each one of them larger than the last, so high that not even the clouds can escape them!" I declared. "I want the curtain walls to be taller than [GetBuilding('casterly_rock_01').GetName] itself, with the towers rising even above that!"\n\nIn some moments it occurred to me that [councillor.GetNameNoTooltip] likely thought me to be mad, a project such as this was likely to take ten years or more, with a cost in both coin and labor beyond anything that had been seen since the Age of Heroes... but, I have made my choice and my will shall be done...\n\n#Bold NOTE: This project will take many years to complete, upon completion an event will trigger which will give a level 5 Castle and the appropriate special building#!"

 cm_harrenhal.9998.desc:0 "After what has felt like an eternity [GetBuilding('harrenhal_01').GetName] is finally complete. It is a sight unlike any that has graced Westeros since the Age of Heroes: massive black curtain walls raising so far into the sky that if one were to look up at them from the ground they would become dizzy, above even those walls rose the tops of 5 towers of black stone, their rooftops piercing the clouds above like the fingers of a giant god. This was a castle unlike any Westeros had ever seen and stands as a reminder of the power of the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName].\n\nMany Riverlanders may have perished during the construction, but, their sacrifice to The [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] was necessary. However, only a fool would believe that this has endeared me to the local population.\n\nAs I stand before these massive walls I can't help but reflect upon the journey that it has taken to arrive here — all of the blood, sacrifice and time this project has taken. I must now take my place within its walls to ensure that my legacy and the legacy of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] will never be forgotten..."

I can't help but reflect upon the journey that it has taken to arrive here — all of the gold, resources and time this project has taken to raise this magnificent keep to the skies themselves. This castle is truly a testament to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and their power and influence upon this world.
