#  mde_longbridge.0010.t: "The Cheese Merchant"
#  mde_longbridge.0010.desc: "Stall after stall, cry after cry, merchants try to lure customers in.\n\nI do my best to ignore them, urging my retinue forward so we can reach the end of the bridge.\n\nBut when I glance to the side, I see a preposterously large man seated behind a booth, counting a pouch heavy with coins. In front of him stands a barker, shouting in a jumble of tongues. One cuts through clearly: “italic “Fine cheese! Pentoshi cheese!”\n\nAnd he’s not wrong. Crates upon crates, loose cheese and cheese rolls stand like sentries all around them.\n\nSo why do I linger?"
#  mde_longbridge.0010.a: "Let’s buy some."
#  mde_longbridge.0010.b: "horrendous smell."
#  mde_longbridge.0010.c: "He’s bigger than an Ibbenese whale!"
