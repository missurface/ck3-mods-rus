 mde_vale.0001.t: "Mountains of the Moon"
 mde_vale.0001.desc: "Before me lies a valley nestled between the Mountains of the Moon. On our way here we’ve heard tales and warnings of Shadow Cats, Mountain Clans, and even a dragon or two.\n\n The peaks loom vast in the distance, their snow-covered summits piercing the clouds. Cold winds rule this valley, and the forests around it whisper with unseen life.\n\nSo why am I here? My company and I are in no shape to face a large group of Mountain Clans. What could these mountains possibly hold?"
 mde_vale.0001.a: "Ask the locals for dragonlore."
 mde_vale.0001.a.f: "Both the dragon Morning and Sheepstealer were rumoured to live in these mountains for a time. Perhaps the local smallfolk have tales or hints to their behavior and patterns."
 mde_vale.0001.b: "Seek out the Burned Men."
 mde_vale.0001.b.f: "A local tale is that the Mountain Clan ‘Burned Men’ is a product of the mountain's inhabitants worshipping the dragon [sheepstealer.GetName]. Perhaps they have something interesting to say, or perhaps I will lose my head..."
 mde_vale.0001.c: "Let's just continue..."

 mde_vale.0101.desc: "After many long days spent prodding through hills, forests, and winding mountain paths, we've gathered a fair amount of information from the smallfolk.\n\nWell, #italic information#!. Most of it consists of local legends, useless family tales, made-up nonsense, and above all, begging.\n\nTravelers are rare in these parts, as the stares and wary questions make plain. But at least, I’ve managed to avoid trouble.\n\nNow, with a small piece of the puzzle in hand, I’m ready to move on."
 mde_vale.0101.a: "Another piece of the puzzle..."

 mde_vale.0201.desc: "Tracking through forests, hills, and mountains, listening to countless smallfolk and shepherds, we find nothing.\n\nWhenever these mountains actually contain savage Clanmen, we have not seen or heard a sign of it.\n\nRunning low on provisions, and with the howls of shadowcats growing closer, it is time to head back down the mountains and return home."
 mde_vale.0201.a: "Let's move on..."

 mde_vale.0202.desc: "Standing before you is a large, deformed man. He calls himself #bold ‘Redhands’#! and fancies himself the leader of this ragged band of thieves and savages.\n\nLurking in his shadow are a gang of barely human figures, clad in rotting clothes stripped from pillaged corpses.
