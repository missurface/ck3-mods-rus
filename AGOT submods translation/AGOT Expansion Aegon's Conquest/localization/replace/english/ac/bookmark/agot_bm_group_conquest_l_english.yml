 agot_bm_ac_desc:0 "When Aegon Targaryen looks east, he sees the past, old, tired, dead but when he looked west, he saw the future, gold in the ground, gold in the fields and no dragons in the sky but his. He and his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya flew over the great continent ostensibly visitors to a strange land but when Aegon returned he ordered construction of a massive table, carved in the shape of Westeros, with all the notable rivers and mountains that they had seen. A personal map of the Seven Kingdoms, then ruled by seven squabbling families. \n \nHouse Durrandon held the Stormlands from their seat at Storm's End, due south of Dragonstone. House Hoare of the Iron Islands had also conquered and enslaved the Riverlands, ruling them from Harrenhal, a monstrous castle rising on the shore of the God's Eye. House Stark held the frozen wasteland of the North, the oldest, largest and emptiest of the kingdoms. House Lannister held the Westerlands, the wealthiest kingdom, thanks to their goldmines. House Gardener held the Reach, the second wealthiest kingdom thanks to their crops. House Arryn held the Vale or rather the Vale held them, the mountains were impassible except through the Bloody Gate, which had never been taken. House Martell held the deserts of Dorne, probably because no one else wanted them. \n \n#bold Together, the Seven Kingdoms made Westeros, a realm that wasn't yet a realm, ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was, Aegon would teach them. #"
