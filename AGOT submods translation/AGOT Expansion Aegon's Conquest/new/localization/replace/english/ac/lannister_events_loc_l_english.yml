 # THE CONQUEST
 lannister.0001:0 "The Dragonlord Turns West"
 lannister.0001.desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen has defeated the Storm King and the Ironborn, seizing control over the first two kingdoms. It is clear that a single kingdom alone cannot hope to stand against this Targaryen and so we must reach out to the Gardener's of Highgarden, the King's of the Reach and form an alliance to pull together the greatest army Westeros has ever seen. \n \nBefore this, hopefully, the Dragonlord will fall. We may yet see victory."
 lannister.0001.option1:0 "Hear Me Roar!"

 lannister.0002:0 "Aegon's Invasion of the Reach"
 lannister.0002.desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen has begun his march into the Reach, we must join the Gardener's in defence and we shall repulse this invader. \n \nNo matter how many dragons Aegon has, we have more in men, the largest army known to Westeros."
 lannister.0002.option1:0 "We will crush them."

 lannister.0003:0 "The Field of Fire"
 lannister.0003.desc:0 "The Gardener armies have been destroyed and their house lays extinct, as I ride away, escaping, we have two options before us. \n \nBend the knee to Aegon Targaryen, save House Lannister from destruction or return to Casterly Rock and continue the war. \n \nWe must make our decision with haste, we lack in time."
 lannister.0003.option1:0 "Bend the knee."
 lannister.0003.option2:0 "The Rock is unsiegable, he shall have to come to us!"

 lannister.0004:0 "Warden of the West"
 lannister.0004.desc:0 "I ran from the Field of Fire after seeing what had happened and now have been detained and brought before Aegon Targaryen. I bend the knee, laying my blade at Aegon's feet before him and his dragon. \n \nIn turn, I have been named Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West."
 lannister.0004.option1:0 "We hope our new King is a good one."
