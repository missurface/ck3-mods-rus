 martell.0001.desc:0 "A host of Dornish spearmen guarded the Prince's Pass, the gateway through the Red Mountains, but Rhaenys did not engage them. She flew above the pass, above the red sands and the white, and descended upon Vaith to demand its submission, only to find the castle empty and abandoned. In the town beneath its walls, only women and children and old men remained. When asked where their lords had gone, they would only say, #bold "Away." #! \n \nThe queen's flight took her to Sunspear, the ancient seat of House Martell, where she found the Princess of Dorne waiting in her abandoned castle. Meria Martell was eighty years of age she was very fat, blind, and almost bald, her skin sallow and sagging. The Yellow Toad of Dorne. \n \nNeither age nor blindness had dulled her wits. \n \n#bold "I will not fight you,"#! Princess Meria told Rhaenys, #bold "nor will I kneel to you. Dorne has no king. Tell your brother that." \n \n"I shall,"#! Rhaenys replied, #bold "but we will come again, Princess, and the next time we shall come with fire and blood." \n \n"Your words,"#! said Princess Meria. #bold "Ours are Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. You may burn us, my lady ... but you will not bend us, break us, or make us bow. This is Dorne. You are not wanted here. Return at your peril." "
 martell.0001.option1:0 "Thus queen and princess parted, and Dorne remained unconquered."

 martell.0003.desc:0 "The Targaryen's have come to claim Dorne but they made a vital mistake, they gave us time, we have now assembled weapons capable of killing their dragons. Scorpians and have enough to possibly get some kill shots upon the Conqueror or his sisters. \n \nDorne will remain unbowed, unbent and unbroken."

 martell.0004.desc:0 "Despite the use of our scorpians, we have failed, House Martell has been cast down and humbled, we lay now as a vassal to House Targaryen. \n \nA puppet to the Targaryen tyranny. \n \nWe failed, we will pay for it but we must continue, we must try to wrestle freedom from this tragedy."
