Not only do I have two sisters as wives but the lands he offers, he does not even possess so has no right to give them in the first place. In response we offered instead the hand of my bastard brother, [orys.GetName] to his daughter alongside additional lands within his actual territory.\n\nInstead of a decent response the idiot cut the hands of our envoy and sent them back to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetName], with the message that “These are the only hands you will receive.” I have had enough of the squabbling of petty lords and false kings, I am the blood of the dragon, my house is the last scion of true Old Valyria, the only dragonriders left to this world. \n #bold \nYet, they underestimate me. No longer. Westeros does not know greatness, I will teach it to them. Ravens will be dispatched across the realm, all shall hear of it from [GetTitleByKey('e_dorne').GetNameNoTier] to [GetTitleByKey('k_the_wall').GetNameNoTier], from now on, Westeros only has one King.

 aegon.1005.desc:0 "At Oldtown, in the Starry Sept, His High Holiness himself anointed [aegon.GetNameNicknamed] with the seven oils, placed a crown upon his head, and proclaimed him #bold [aegon.GetNameNoTooltip] of House [aegon.GetDynasty.GetName], the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. #! \n\nOnly a handful of lords had been present for [aegon.GetNameNoTooltip]'s first coronation at the mouth of the Blackwater, but hundreds were on hand to witness his second, and tens of thousands cheered him afterward in the streets of [GetTitleByKey('c_oldtown').GetNameNoTier] as he rode through the city on [balerion.GetNameNicknamed]'s back. Amongst those at [aegon.GetNameNoTooltip]'s second coronation were the maesters and archmaesters of the Citadel. Perhaps for that reason, it was this coronation, rather than the Aegonfort crowning on the day of Aegon's landing, that became fixed as the start of [aegon.GetNameNoTooltip]'s reign. \n\nThus were the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros hammered into one great realm, by the will of [aegon.GetNameNoTooltip] the Conqueror and his sisters."
