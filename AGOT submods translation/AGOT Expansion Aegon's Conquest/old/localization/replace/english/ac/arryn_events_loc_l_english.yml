We must act quickly to spare bloodshed and the best terms.\n\nMy mother, [sharra.GetName] will send an offer of her marriage to King [aegon.GetName] and that since he has no sons, he will name me as his heir!\n\nTo think!

 arryn.0003.desc:0 "Mother had strengthened the defenses of Gulltown, moved a strong host to the Bloody Gate, and tripled the size of the garrisons in Stone, Snow, and Sky, the waycastles that guarded the approach to the Eyrie. All these defenses proved useless against [visenya.GetName], who rode [vhagar.GetName]’s leathery wings above them all and landed in the Eyrie’s inner courtyard. When my mother, [sharra.GetName], rushed out to confront her, with a dozen guards at her back, she found Visenya with me seated on her knee, staring at the dragon, wonder-struck.\n\n #bold “Mother, can I go flying with the lady?” #!the boy king asked. No threats were spoken, no angry words exchanged. The two queens smiled at one another and exchanged courtesies instead."
