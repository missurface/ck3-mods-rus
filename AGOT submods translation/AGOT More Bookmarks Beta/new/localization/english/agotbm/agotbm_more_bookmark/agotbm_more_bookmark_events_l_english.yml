 blackfyre_bookmark_rebellion.0001.t:0 "The Black Dragon"
 blackfyre_bookmark_rebellion.0001_desc:0 "For years, prominent lords of the realm have called me the true heir to the throne. They say I am the spitting image of the Conqueror. My brother Bittersteel and my mentor Fireball both conspire in my name without my consent. But perhaps they are right? Perhaps Daeron truly is falseborn and illegitimate. It would seem so with how he has sold my sister away to the Dornish and gave favors and rights to these foreigners. When my father granted me Blackfyre and legitimized me, he all but officially declared me his true heir. "

Since his dishonorable slaying at the Battle of Redgrass Field, we have lived in exile. However, the time has come for us to cross the Narrow Sea and reclaim what rightfully belongs to the Black Dragon."

 got_bookmark.0001.t:0 "Plots in the Capitol"
 got_bookmark.0001_desc:0 "When King Robert named me Hand of the King, I had no choice but to accept. It wasn't only out of loyalty to my king and friend, but because I had to uncover the truth behind Jon Arryn's death. Lysa whispers of the Lannisters' hand in it. And now, while we hosted the royal family at Winterfell, my son Bran suffered a fall that nearly claimed his life—an accident, they call it, though his steps have always been sure. Catelyn is convinced he was pushed, silenced before he could speak of what he saw.\n\n If there's truth in this, I will discover it."
 got_bookmark.0001.a:0 "Hopefully Sansa and Arya adjust to the south well."

 got_bookmark.0002_desc:0 "Robert's words on the King's Road still haunt me:\n #bold "There’s a war coming, Ned. I don’t know when or who we’ll be fighting, but it’s coming."#!\n\n I can feel it now, too—like a storm of swords building on the horizon. \n \n My investigation into Jon Arryn's death has yielded some curious discoveries. It seems Jon and Stannis Baratheon were often in each other’s company before Jon’s untimely end. Strangely, they visited brothels together, an oddity for men of their standing. With Petyr Baelish’s help, I’ve uncovered that they weren’t seeking pleasure, but rather checking on Robert’s many bastards. Why they were so concerned with the king’s illegitimate children, I cannot yet say."
 got_bookmark.0002.a:0 "Perhaps the books he read would help me understand his mind better."
 got_bookmark.0002.a.tt:0 "You will ask Grand Maester Pycelle for any books Jon Arryn had been reading."
 
 got_bookmark.0003.t:0 "Abominations of Incest"
 got_bookmark.0003_desc:0 "I've learned the cold truth that Jon Arryn had died for. The King has no trueborn sons. Every single one of Robert's bastards had his black hair and every Baratheon before him as well. The Queen erased any doubt in my mind when she confessed privately that the Kingslayer, Jamie Lannister, is the father of Joffrey, Tommen, and Mrycella. \n \n What is worse, Robert has been mortally wounded on his hunt. On his deathbed, Robert asks me to help Joffrey rule. But Joffrey is not his heir and I cannot bear to tell him."
 got_bookmark.0003.a:0 "The throne must pass to Robert's heir, Stannis."
 got_bookmark.0003.a.tt:0 "With the assistance of Petyr Baelish and the City Watch, I will take the pretender into custody and invite Stannis to take his seat on the Iron Throne."
 
 got_bookmark.0003.b:0 "The realm must know. Jon is the true heir."
 got_bookmark.0003.b.tt:0 "I will reveal the truth. Jon Snow is not a bastard or my son. He is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my sister Lyanna. The throne belongs to him and I will see him on it after Robert passes."
 
 
 
 got_bookmark.0004.t:0 "Eddard Stark, Traitor to the Realm"
 got_bookmark.0004_desc:0 "After Robert's death, we made our move on the throne room. With the City Watch and my own household guard, I believed the transition of power in King’s Landing would be swift and uncontested. But we were betrayed. Janos Slynt and Petyr Baelish turned on us, sealing our fate. My entire household was cut down, and my daughters now languish in the hands of these treacherous men.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, I thought mercy had been granted. They offered me the chance to take the Black, and I believed my family’s safety had been assured. But upon the steps of the Sept of Baelor, Joffrey shattered that hope. He called for my head. Ser Ilyn Payne stepped forward, wielding Ice—House Stark’s ancestral greatsword—ready to deliver the final blow."
 got_bookmark.0004.a:0 "Robb... he's just a boy."
 got_bookmark.0004.a.tt:0 "Ned is beheaded and his head mounted on a spike. Sansa is held a prisoner. Arya has dissapeared. How will Robb Stark respond?"

 got_bookmark.0005_desc:0 "The realm was a rotting carcass, and it sickened him to watch the crows pick at it while others danced on the bones. Robert had left it to ruin, seven kingdoms he never cared to rule, seven kingdom he had squandered. Renly, that preening fool, now thinks he will win it with smiles and pretty words, but Stannis knew better. He had always known better. But now the Iron Throne was his by right. If the realm needed saving, he would save it, but there would be no songs, no feasts, no laughter in his reign. Only the cold truth of his will, and the fire to scour the false kings from his throne."
 got_bookmark.0005.a:0 "By right of birth and blood I do lay claim to the Iron Throne."

 got_bookmark.0007_desc:0 "Balon Greyjoy stood by the window, staring out at the roiling waves beneath Pyke’s cliffs, the salt wind biting at his face like an old lover’s cruel caress. Theon had returned, not as the boy he’d sent away, but as a Stark in all but name, dressed in their furs and talking of alliances, of bending the knee to wolves while the lions sharpened their claws on the riverlands. He spoke of Robb Stark as a brother, as if Balon’s blood ran thin in his veins. The thought was a bitter one, like swallowing seawater. Yet... there was sense in it, if he could but choke down the bile. Let the Stark boy bleed the lions dry, and when they were spent, Balon could rise, not as a servant to some wolf or stag, but as a true ruler of Salt and Rock. However, with Stark fighting in the South, perhaps his own lands lay undefended. One thing was for certain, Balon had knelt once, and that had cost him everything. Never again. The Ironborn do not sow."

 got_bookmark.0006_desc:0 "A king must be loved, Loras had whispered, his breath warm against Renly’s ear the night before. And gods, how right he was. Renly knew in his heart he was the better man to wear the crown, the one who could unite them all—high lords and smallfolk alike. And yet... Stannis. His brother. Cold, humorless, hard as iron, but Renly could still see the older brother he once loved. Could he truly snatch the crown from Stannis's grasp? The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth, though Loras was always there to sweeten it."
 got_bookmark.0006.a:0 "Stannis is not a King. I am."
 got_bookmark.0006.a.tt:0 "I will claim the throne. Loras will go to Highgarden to solicit Lord Tyrell's help and secure Margaery's hand in marriage."

The Lannisters will pay for this. \n \n When news had reached his camp of northerners and riverlords, the calls for justice and war had reached a fever pitch.\n\n The gathering was in a heated debate on how to continue and who to support. Stannis was Robert Baratheon's heir. However a strong sentiment has arisen amongst my bannermen that they will not bend their knees to a southern king again. They mean to declare me King in the North, the title of my forebears"

Something I would have never done despite how Robert treated me.\n\n Lady Melisandre says she has seen my brother's army bend the knee to me. That I will sit upon the throne. But first, she says, there must be sacrifices. My brother must die."
