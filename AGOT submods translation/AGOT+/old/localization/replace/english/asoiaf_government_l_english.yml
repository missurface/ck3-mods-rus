Nobles rule over the smallfolk within their territory through a system of fealty and sworn oaths. In this system, each man owes military service to his lord in return for protection, a grant of land, and the peasants to work it.\n\nWestern feudalism in particular is native to Westeros, unique in the fact that vassals are called "lords" regardless of their place on the hierarchy, the most powerful of which are sometimes called "Lords Paramount", or even afforded princely titles like in Dorne."
