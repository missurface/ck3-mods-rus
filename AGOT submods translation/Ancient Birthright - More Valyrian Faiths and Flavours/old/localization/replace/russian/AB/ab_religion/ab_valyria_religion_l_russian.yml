 the_seven_targaryen_desc: "When Aegon the Conqueror unified the Seven Kingdoms, he and his decendents would adopt the Faith of the Seven.

  volantene_faith_desc:0 "'Tala hen Perzys' or 'Daughter of the Flame' is the name used to refer to the worshippers of the Valyrian gods in Volantis. Since the Doom of Valyria the faith has been steadily declining in favour of other cults or R'hllorism. Today, it is only practiced by a small number of staunch traditionalists among the Volantene nobility and in the more remote regions of the state. Although the followers of 'Tala he Perzys' like to claim they represent an unbroken strain of Valyrian religious orthodoxy, even their faith has been significantly influenced by other religions. Most noteably R'hllorism, as can be seen by the heavy emphasis the faith puts on fire rituals.

Originating in the vibrant and diverse sea port of Elyria its followers seek to spread their lords light from port to port until every ocean shines with his radiance...At least that is what they claim. Many observers have pointed out that their 'holy mission' seems to be nothing but an excuse for personal enrichment." #NT!

  mantaryan_desc:0 "After the Doom befell Valyria, many ancient cultural and religious beliefs were shattered. Nowhere is this more obvious then in Mantarys. For generation the people of the Painted Mountains worshiped the dragons of Valyria as living gods. Following the Doom of Valyria and the nnear extinction of the dragons that came with it, the Mantari became a highly suspicious and isolationist people. Whilestill worshiping the Dragon idols of their ancestors they have developed a fierce hatred for magic and its practitioners whom they deem responsibile for the death of their gods. The Mantari believe that only by cleansing themselves of all forms of magic can they recieve absolution in the next life, where they will be united with their fallen gods once again.

 maegor_desc: "Although Maegor's rule ultimately ended in defeat, there were still those who remained loyal to his cause until the very end. In the years after, these loyalists began to organise in secret, forming covenants and lamenting the realm's fall from what they precieved to be Valyrian purity. Firmly convinced that Maegor's death was a conspiracy orchestrated by the Worshippers of the Seven, they seek to eradicate the Andalic gods tooth and nail, guiding all those of Valyrian blood back to 'Orthodoxy'. It is unclear, if Maegor himself ever held such beliefs. However his followers have proven to be quite adamant." #NT!

 imperial_valyrian_desc: "'Geron ēlȳr Jaedārys' or 'Path of the First Emperor' is a faith which dates back to the last days of the old Freehold. Aurion, sick and tired of the endless bickering and infighting between the factions of the high court, sought to radically reform Valyria's politcal system. Claiming to have recieved a vision from the Gods, he advocated that the noblest and purest of all Dragonlords should rule Valyria by divine mandate as 'Jaedārys' or 'Emperor'. Although Aurion was able to gain a sizeable following, the Doom that soon followed and his disapearance shortly after had forced his remaining followers to reinterpret many of his teachings. What little remains of Aurions following consideres him to be the first Jaedārys, a martyr who died while trying to fulfil his sacred mission of renewing Valyria. Even to this day, there a still those who believe a new Jaedārys will one day rise to reclaim what was lost and fulfil Aurions dream." #NT!

 flames_of_passion_desc: "The Flames of Passion trace their origins back to a powerful faction within the ranks of the Valyrian Bloodmages who strongly emphasised the life giving quality of Blood Magic over its more destructive qualities. After the Doom of Valyria, a small fraction of this group went east where this already strongly female centered group adapted many religious and cultural practices of the Court of Leng. Appart from it's largely matriarchical structure, the Flames of Passion's most striking difference to the western Valyrian Cults is its staunch opposition to any form of slavery, believing it to be a practice beneath an otherwise morally and genetically pure Valyrian race." #NT!

 fair_lady_desc: "The Cult of Pure Beauty is one the oldest cults in the Free Cities. While originaly hailing from some of the more hedonistic factions within the Valyrian court, it has evolved quite a bit since those days. At its core, it is still a very Valyrian faith with its heavy emphasis on blood purity and proper lineage. The most striking difference however, is the cult's openly matriarchical structure, founded in the believe that only women can give birth to children of pure Valyrian blood and beauty." #NT!
