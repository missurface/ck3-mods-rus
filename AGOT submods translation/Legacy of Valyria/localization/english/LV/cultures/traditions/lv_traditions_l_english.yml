  agot_tradition_north_valyrian_1_name:0 "Echoes of the [valyrian_freehold_short|E]"
  agot_tradition_north_valyrian_1_desc:0 "The Doom may have claimed Valyria in fire and ruin, but its echo persists in these cities—fading, twisted, and half-forgotten. Here, ancient traditions are followed without understanding, and legends of a glorious past haunt the shadows. This culture is the legacy of a lost empire, a tapestry woven from remnants of a power that once touched the sky but now lies in the dust, unable to either fully fade or return."

Now, after centuries of slumber, the blood of old Valyria stirs, and the fire that once carved its legacy into stone and steel is rising. This rebirth is no shadowed echo but a resurgence of raw power and ambition, guided by ancient wisdom and tempered by the mistakes of a fractured past. Traditions once blindly followed are now renewed with purpose, while legends come alive—not as myths but as blueprints for a restored empire."
