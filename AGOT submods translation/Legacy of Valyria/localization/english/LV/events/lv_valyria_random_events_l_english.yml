 lv_valyria_random_event.0010.t:0 "The Red-Robed Figures"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0010.desc:0 "Through the haze, you see them - pale, with long, white hair. Their faces stark against the ash. Dark red robes hang from their shoulders. They do not move. They only stare. When you blink, they are gone."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0010.a:0 "They were watching me."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0010.b:0 "I am their successor... or am I?"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0010.c:0 "They are real - more real than the living."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0020.t:0 "They Are Here Again"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0020.desc:0 "Once more you see them, amid the ruins. Closer now, their white hair gleaming in the firelight. Their eyes meet yours, unblinking. When you approach, they vanish, leaving only footprints in the ash that fade before your eyes."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0020.a:0 "I cannot endure their gaze."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0020.b:0 "They test me - I will show them that I am worthy."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0020.c:0 "Yes... yes, I walk beside them..."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0030.t:0 "The Dead Among You"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0030.desc:0 "This time they do not vanish. The pale figures stand among your companions, silent, their red robes brushing the ash. No one else reacts. Their faces are turned only toward you. You blink - and the world tilts. They are gone... yet you are not certain you remain yourself."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0030.a:0 "What does all of this mean?"
 
 lv_valyria_random_event.0031.t:0 "Claimed"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0031.desc:0 "The figures draw close. Their pale hands reach for you, and in an instant the world fades to black. When your companions look, you are simply gone."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0031.a:0 "They take me into the ash."
 
 lv_valyria_random_event.0032.t:0 "They Live In Me Now..."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0032.desc:0 "The figures dissolve into ash — yet you feel them within you, their voices whispering in a tongue older than men. Their eyes look out through yours."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0032.a:0 "I am not alone in my own mind."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0033.t:0 "A Cursed Gift"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0033.desc:0 "When the figures vanish, something remains in the ash - a fragment of Valyria, glimmering faintly with an inner light. You take it in trembling hands, though the memory of their eyes burns still."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0033.a:0 "It is mine now... whatever the cost."


 lv_valyria_random_event.0040.t:0 "The Dragon Above"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0040.desc:0 "Through the haze of ash and smoke, a vast shadow drifts across the sky. For a moment the clouds part, and you behold wings stretched wide, scales glimmering like molten steel, a dragon soaring over the shattered city. Yet when you blink, it is gone - leaving only silence and the shifting gloom. Did you truly see it... or only dream it?"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0040.a:0 "Real or not, I will remember this sight until my dying day."


 lv_valyria_random_event.0050.t:0 "The Vanishing City"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0050.desc:0 "The ruins shift before your eyes. A black spire that guided your steps is gone when you turn your head, replaced by empty ground. Streets you walked only hours before lead nowhere, or back to where you began. Your companions whisper of sorcery in the air."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0050.a:0 "It watches us. It moves when we do."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0050.b:0 "The Doom warped even the stones."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0050.c:0 "Yes... it lives. The city breathes around us."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0060.t:0 "Lost in the Vanishing City"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0060.desc:0 "You wander among towers that change when unobserved, streets that shift beneath your feet. Familiar faces vanish, voices echo in wrong places, and every path seems to lead deeper into the ash. The city does not wish you to leave."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0060.a:0 "This place breaks the spirit."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0060.b:0 "The city whispers... and I must obey."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0060.c:0 "Through confusion comes discovery."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0070.t:0 "Treasure in the Ashes"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0070.desc:0 "A twisting corridor collapses, revealing a hidden vault. Scattered coins and half-melted ornaments glitter in the ash - remnants of Valyrian splendor."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0070.a:0 "Fortune favors the bold."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0080.t:0 "The City Claims Its Own"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0080.desc:0 "The voices of your companions grow faint. Walls fold around you, streets blur, towers loom impossibly tall. You cry out, but no one hears. Valyria swallows you whole, vanishing into its shifting maze."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0080.a:0 "..."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0090.t:0 "Tremor in the Ash"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0090.desc:0 "The ground lurches beneath your feet, and the ash-filled air splits with a roar. Walls collapse, towers lean, and cracks split open to reveal rivers of molten fire. Your companions scatter in panic as the ruin itself threatens to swallow you."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0090.a:0 "Flee before the earth devours us!"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0090.b:0 "There may be treasures hidden in the fire..."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0090.c:0 "Hold steady! Do not let fear break us!"

 lv_valyria_random_event.0100.t:0 "Emberling Swarm"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0100.desc:0 "A cloud of tiny draconic creatures descends upon you, each no bigger than a fist but innumerable. They hiss and screech, biting and clawing, devouring anything alive in their path. Ash and fire trail behind them as they move like a living storm, relentless and horrifying."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0100.a:0 "Fight them off... or perish!"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0100.b:0 "Try to capture a few... if you survive."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0100.c:0 "Hold together and survive the swarm."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0110.t:0 "Ash Serpent Ambush"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0110.desc:0 "Huge pale serpents slither through the ash plains, striking suddenly at your party. Their jaws snap with terrifying speed, and their scales radiate heat. You must act quickly if you hope to survive."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0110.a:0 "Stand and fight!"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0110.b:0 "Flee and survive!"

 lv_valyria_random_event.0120.t:0 "Toxic Fumes"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0120.desc:0 "A thick, acrid vapor seeps from fissures in the blackened ground, burning your eyes and throat. The air is heavy with sulfur — each breath threatens to suffocate you. Pushing forward could prove fatal, but retreat would cost precious time."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0120.a:0 "Cover your mouth and push through."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0120.b:0 "Retreat for safer paths."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0120.c:0 "Burn supplies to mask the air."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0130.t:0 "Aftermath: Illness"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0130.desc:0 "Coughing wracks your body as the illness settles into your lungs, weakening your strength."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0130.a:0 "Rally against the fever."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0130.b:0 "I feel weaker by the hour."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0140.t:0 "Aftermath: Burned"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0140.desc:0 "Smoldering pain from ash and sulfur sears your skin. Scars burn, reminding you of how close death was."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0140.a:0 "Alive, at last."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0150.t:0 "Aftermath: Retreat"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0150.desc:0 "You manage to withdraw from the toxic air, but the memory of proximity to death lingers, making every step feel uncertain."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0150.a:0 "We press on, shattered but alive."

 lv_valyria_random_event.0160.t:0 "Aftermath: Sacrificed Supplies"
 lv_valyria_random_event.0160.desc:0 "You burned what little you had to mask the fumes. The air cleared, but the loss of resources now haunts each journeying step."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0160.a:0 "The sacrifice was worth making."
 lv_valyria_random_event.0160.b:0 "I fear for what we gave up."
