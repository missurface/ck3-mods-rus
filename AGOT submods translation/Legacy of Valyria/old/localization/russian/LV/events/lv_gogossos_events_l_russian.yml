Mist rises from the canopy below, swirling like ghostly tendrils between the ancient trees, their emerald leaves glistening with the remnants of the day's heat. But beyond the jungle, beyond the wild, untamed beauty, my eyes lock onto something truly magnificent—a palace of pure white stone, standing regal and defiant atop a distant hill. Its towering spires pierce the sky, catching the last light of day, gleaming like the citadel of forgotten gods.\n A thrill surges through me, an undeniable pull, as if fate itself is calling.

From the outside, its gleaming white walls and towering spires stand untouched by time, regal and unyielding. But within, decay has taken hold. The once-majestic halls are crumbling, their gilded arches cracked and weathered. Dust chokes the air, and the scent of rot lingers in the stagnant silence. Broken furniture, long since reduced to ruin, lies scattered across the stone floors, its once-rich fabrics reduced to nothing but tattered remnants of the past.\n\nI search, pressing deeper into the abandoned corridors, but I find nothing—no treasure, no sign of life, only echoes of a forgotten age. It feels as if the palace itself is a husk, an empty shell of grandeur that time has long since forsaken. Yet, just as doubt begins to creep in, I come upon a staircase, winding downward into shadow.\n\nDrawn forward, I descend into the basement, where the last rays of sunlight filter through intricate crystal mirrors, casting shimmering beams of gold and violet across the chamber. The light catches on something breathtaking—ancient Valyrian artworks, etched into the stone above the great door before me. The images tell a story of power and fire, of mighty Dragonlords reigning over the skies, their great beasts coiling through clouds of flame. Their eyes, carved from precious gemstones, glint in the fractured light, as if watching me, judging me.\n I linger, captivated by the artistry, by the sheer weight of history pressing down upon this place. But then a chilling realization settles over me—throughout this entire palace, I have seen no sign of the dead. No skeletons. No remains of those who once called this place home.\n A place abandoned by time... yet seemingly untouched by death.\nA shiver runs down my spine as I step closer to the great door, my hand hovering over its cold surface.

Shadows twist and writhe along the ancient stone walls, yet I press on, driven by equal parts curiosity and unease. Finally, I reach the bottom—a vast chamber, impossibly illuminated despite the depths. The light, soft and golden, spills from unseen sources, casting an otherworldly glow upon the walls.\n\nMy breath catches as I take in the sight before me another magnificent mural, its artistry unmatched, radiating a sense of awe and reverence. This one depicts dragons in their full, majestic glory, each unique, each breathtaking in its splendor.\n\nThe Mighty Purple Dragon, its scales shimmering like amethyst, unleashes a torrent of fire, its power unmatched.\n\nThe White Dragon, swift and fierce, seems almost to blur in motion, its slender frame cutting through clouds like a blade.\n The Red Dragon, its eyes burning with malice, looms as a tyrant, its presence commanding fear and dread.\n\nAnd finally, the Black Dragon—mysterious, mythical, its form shrouded in an aura of dark majesty, as though it exists between this world and the next.\n\nI have but a moment to marvel at the mural's beauty, my fingers tracing the edge of the intricate carvings. Then, the sound comes. A low, familiar groan of ancient stone shifting. My heart seizes in my chest, and a chill races down my spine as the noise grows louder, more violent. I whip around, eyes wide with alarm, just as the floor beneath me gives way.\n The world tilts, and I'm weightless, my scream catching in my throat as the stone crumbles into darkness.

Just the cold, unyielding stone, the eerie glow of the crystals, and the oppressive silence that seems to stretch into eternity.\n\nI'm doomed to waste away here, trapped in this endless nightmare, with nothing but these cursed doors and my own growing despair for company. My strength is already failing me, my body weakening with every passing moment. I can feel the emptiness creeping in, my mind clawing at the edges of sanity.\n\nBut I won't let it end like this. I refuse to wither into a husk, to become a shadow of myself, forgotten and consumed by this place. If this is to be my end, it will be on my terms, by my own hand. I will not let dishonor take me, nor the slow, cruel grip of starvation.\n\nI glance at the doors one last time, their silent presence mocking me, and steel myself for what must be done.

Each door is massive and carved with intricate designs, their details illuminated by the shimmering light of the crystals above. My heart pounds as I take a step closer, drawn to their ominous presence.\n\nThe doors are unlike anything I've seen before, each one radiating its own distinct aura, as though imbued with power.\n\nThe Purple Door gleams like polished amethyst, its surface alive with carvings of flames and twisting serpentine dragons. The fire they breathe seems almost to move when the light hits it just right, and the air around it hums with an unearthly energy.\n\nThe White Door, in stark contrast, is sleek and smooth, like polished ivory. Its carvings depict a dragon in flight, its form slender and graceful, wings spread wide as if caught in eternal motion. The cold light of the crystals gives it an almost spectral glow, as though it's untouched by time.\n\nThe Red Door is bold and terrifying. Its surface is etched with jagged, chaotic patterns, the lines deep and rough, as though scorched into the wood by fire itself. A monstrous dragon with cruel, sharp eyes is carved into its frame, its presence radiating menace. Even standing near it makes the air feel heavy and oppressive.\n\nThe Black Door is the most enigmatic. It seems to absorb the light, its surface smooth and dark as obsidian. Shadows seem to dance across it, shifting and twisting like they have a life of their own. The carvings here are subtle and difficult to make out, but the dragon depicted feels otherworldly, almost incomprehensible—more spirit than beast.\n\nEach door pulses faintly with an unseen force, as though beckoning me forward. Yet there's no indication of what lies behind them. My eyes flicker between them, my mind racing. Is this the end of the palace? Or is it the beginning of something far worse?\n\nMy instincts scream at me to choose carefully, but no matter what, I know there's no turning back now.

The walls are carved from the same ancient stone as the rest of the palace, but here they're lined with faintly glowing runes—patterns of forgotten language that pulse softly as if alive. The corridor seems alive with an eerie energy, a strange vibration that I can feel in my bones.\n\nThe floor beneath me is damp, slick with condensation, and every step I take sends an echo down the corridor that bounces back to me like a whisper. It feels like the place is watching, listening, waiting.\n\nThere's something unsettling about this hallway—something that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.

 gogossos_expedition.1009_desc: "At last, the corridor ends. Before me, an old wooden door lies shattered on the ground, its splintered remains scattered like the remnants of some long-forgotten barrier. Beyond the broken frame lies a room unlike anything I've encountered in this palace—a mage's quarters, untouched by time but heavy with the weight of abandonment.\n\nThe room is a chaotic masterpiece, its walls lined with towering bookshelves crammed with ancient tomes, scrolls, and fragments of parchment. The air is thick with the faint scent of aged paper and the acrid tang of long-dormant alchemical experiments. Glass vials, some cracked and others still intact, clutter the tables, filled with liquids that glimmer faintly under the pale light of the crystals above. Strange devices, their purpose unfathomable, sit alongside them, their brass and silver frames tarnished yet oddly intricate.\n\nBut it's the table at the back of the room that draws my attention. There, slumped over its surface, is a skeleton draped in a tattered hooded robe. The bones are yellowed with age, yet there's something strangely deliberate about its positioning. It's as though the mage—if that's what he was—knew the end was coming and chose this place as his final resting spot.\n\nIn front of the skeleton, scattered across the table, lies a collection of items. A dusty, leather-bound journal, its cover cracked but intact, sits at the center. The air around it feels heavy, as though it holds secrets meant to stay buried. Beside the journal, gleaming even in the faint light, are several gold bars, their edges worn but unmistakable in their value.\n\nI step closer, my breath shallow as I take it all in. The journal seems to almost call to me, its presence commanding my attention far more than the gold ever could. My fingers hover over its cover, hesitating. This room feels like it holds answers—or perhaps more questions.\n\nWho was this mage? What happened to him?

My fingers trace the cracked leather cover as I flip through its fragile pages, the ink faded but still legible. I quickly scan the last entry, drawn to the final thoughts of the long-dead mage.\n\nThe words chill me to my core. He wrote of his final hours, of how the Gogossosi Blood Plague had taken hold of his body, ravaging him from within. His descriptions are vivid and haunting—of the fever, the bleeding, and the weakness that consumed him, robbing him of the strength to continue his work. He lamented his unfinished experiments, his wasted potential, and the legacy he would never leave behind. His despair seeps from the page, each word a painful reminder of how cruel and final his end must have been.\n\nBut before I could delve further, the room began to tremble. A low rumble, like the growl of an awakening beast, vibrates through the stone walls. Dust falls in thick clouds from above, and the faint light of the crystals begins to flicker wildly. I glance up as small rocks start to fall, followed by the groaning cracks of the ceiling shifting under unseen pressure. The room is collapsing.\n\nPanic floods my veins. I shove the journal back onto the table—it's too heavy, too fragile to carry—and instead snatch up the gleaming gold bars. My instincts scream at me to run, to escape before I'm buried alive alongside the mage's remains.\n\nI bolt for the door—or what's left of it—but just as I reach the threshold, the runic script carved into the floor flares to life. The glowing symbols pulse with blinding intensity, filling the room with an otherworldly radiance. The sound of the collapsing room is drowned out by a sharp, almost deafening hum, and before I can process what's happening, my vision is consumed by white light.\n\nWhen the light fades, I'm no longer in the palace.\n\nI'm standing on a beach. Warm sand shifts beneath my feet, the sound of waves crashing against the shore filling my ears. The salty tang of the sea air is an impossible contrast to the cold, decaying atmosphere I'd just left. My heart races as I whirl around, trying to understand what just happened. The palace, the collapsing room, the mage—it's all gone, replaced by the endless horizon of ocean and sky.\n\nI clutch the gold bars tightly, my breath still ragged from the chaos, my mind racing with questions. How am I here? Why did the runes teleport me to this place? Was this a failsafe left by the mage, or some unseen force intervening?\n\nThe only certainty is that I've escaped—for now. But this beach... it feels too peaceful, too perfect. And deep down, I knew it was all real." #NT!

 gogossos_expedition.1100_desc: "As I descend into the basement, a chill runs down my spine. The air is thick with dust and the scent of something ancient—something long forgotten. My footsteps echo in the dim light, but then I stop abruptly, frozen in place.\n\nBefore me, looming in the shadows, is a dragon. A real, living dragon. Its massive form is coiled in the darkness, scales shimmering faintly even in the gloom. My breath catches in my throat. This shouldn't be possible. The Dragonlords of old have long since faded into legend—how could one of their beasts still exist here, hidden away beneath this place?\n\nA mixture of awe and terror grips me, but amidst the fear, another thought takes hold. There is more to this place than I ever imagined. Secrets buried beneath centuries, mysteries waiting to be unraveled.\n\nBut I didn't come all this way just to turn back empty-handed. If this dragon has been preserved here for so long, there must be something of great value hidden within these walls. And I intend to claim my reward" #NT!

 gogossos_expedition.1101_desc: "The battle was fierce, every moment a test of will and endurance. The dragon roared, its fiery breath scorching the air, but I had already learned to read its movements. With each thunderous strike of its claws, I danced between death and survival, my blade finding openings where scales parted just enough. It lunged, and I rolled beneath it, driving my weapon deep into its exposed underbelly. A deafening screech tore through the chamber as the beast thrashed, its massive tail shattering stone in its final, desperate struggle.\n\nWith one last surge of strength, I climbed onto its back, gripping the ridges of its spine as I drove my sword through the base of its skull. The dragon let out a final, shuddering breath before collapsing, its enormous body shaking the ground as it fell. I stood over it, chest heaving, blood and soot clinging to my skin. The once-mighty creature lay still, its long-forgotten reign finally brought to an end.\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, but I felt no regret. I had slain a legend—and now, the spoils of its ancient lair were mine for the taking." #NT!

 gogossos_expedition.1102_desc: "Having slain the dragon and claimed its hoard, I turned my gaze toward the far end of the chamber, where something far more ominous awaited. A massive door, forged from blackened steel, loomed before me. Twisted and jagged, its surface bore the image of a snarling face, frozen in an eternal grimace, its gaping maw wide enough to swallow a man whole.\n\nIn front of the door stood a stone pillar, ancient and weathered, upon which rested a simple bowl. It was unremarkable at first glance, save for the strange runes etched along its rim—symbols that seemed to shift and writhe under my gaze. Inside the bowl, a rusted dagger lay motionless, its once-sharp edge dulled by time and decay.\n\nAs I stepped closer, a shiver ran down my spine. Whispers—soft, insidious—brushed against my mind like cold fingers. They beckoned me, murmuring words I could not understand yet somehow felt within my bones. They pulled at me, urging me forward, compelling me to take up the dagger.\n\nThe offering it demanded was clear. Blood. My own. The runes pulsed faintly as if sensing my hesitation, the whispers growing impatient. Whatever lay beyond that door would not reveal itself without sacrifice." #NT!

Blood welled instantly, flowing in thick, crimson rivulets into the waiting bowl. The runes lining its rim flared with a sickly glow, as if drinking deeply from my offering.\n\nThen, the door groaned. A slow, grating sound, metal grinding against stone. The twisted face carved into it seemed to shift, its once-snarling expression curling into something far worse—a grin. A deep, knowing grin. A wave of dizziness washed over me. My vision blurred, darkening at the edges. I swayed on my feet, struggling to stay upright, but my limbs felt impossibly heavy. Still, I saw it—the door was opening. Whatever was beyond it lay within my reach. I forced myself forward, willing my body to move. But then I fell. A sharp, unforgiving collapse to the cold stone floor. Panic surged through me as I tried to rise, but my strength was gone. The dagger slipped from my fingers, clattering uselessly beside me. And then, the true horror set in.\n\nThe pain. It started as a slow, creeping sensation beneath my skin, then bloomed into agony. My flesh tingled, then burned, then withered. I gasped, but no breath came. My veins blackened, my skin cracked and peeled, sloughing away in sickening sheets. Blood no longer flowed from just my hand—it poured from everywhere. My body was unraveling, rotting away before my very eyes. I tried to scream, but my throat collapsed in on itself, my voice stolen by the very force I had sought to awaken. The last thing I saw before darkness took me was the door, standing wide open. And beyond it—shadows, shifting and watching.\n\nThen, nothing." #NT!

A sharp tingling sensation raced across my palm, and when I looked down, the wound was gone. My skin had knit itself back together, the blood offering taken, but leaving no trace of harm. My breath was unsteady as I stepped forward, past the threshold of the now-open door, into the chamber beyond.\n\nThe Vault of Wishes.\n\nMy eyes widened as I took in the sight before me—golden artifacts stacked high, jeweled goblets glinting in the dim torchlight, gemstones scattered like mere pebbles upon the floor. Wealth beyond imagining, untouched for centuries. This was the true treasure, the hoard the dragon had been guarding, the prize hidden beyond its monstrous form.\n\nBut among the glittering riches, one object drew my gaze above all else. Sitting atop a pedestal, bathed in an ethereal glow, was the artifact I had been searching for. The reason I had come this far.

I can't keep doing this. The endless cycle, the suffocating repetition—it's breaking me. But I refuse to let madness take hold. I refuse to starve, to wither away in this place, waiting for an escape that doesn't exist.\n\nIf this is all there is, then I will end it on my own terms" #NT!
