  ruin_history_generic:0 "The world itself is dotted with ruins, from Westeros to Essos, from Sothoryos to Ulthos; they spread across every land and every climate with little to no regard. Some were once great fortresses and castles, standing against enemies for thousands of years, only to be laid down to an unbeatable foe, others were watchtowers and small holdfasts that were broken by minor raids lost to time. Some are ancient beyond all reckoning, having been laid to ruin before the earliest records in the Citadel or Yi Ti, such as Yeen in Sothoryos, or Stygai in the Shadow. Others’ falls have been more recent and documented by the scholars of both the Sunset and Sunrise lands. Many have had legends, stories, or songs addressing them, or their last stand, and more lie forgotten and shunned by all singers.\n\nTo claim a destroyed county and begin reconstruction, go to the holding view and choose \"Restore Ruins\". When you own a ruins barony, you can upgrade the main ruins building to start restoration.\n\nOnly men men maddened by ambition, wanderlust, or their lost heritage would dare to lay claim to the more perilous ruins, such as those born from the Doom of Valyria. Experienced travelers or scions of the ancient dragonlords deluded enough to try may begin an activity to set forth on an expedition to Valyria."
