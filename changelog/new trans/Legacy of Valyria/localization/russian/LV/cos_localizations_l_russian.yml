 agot_tradition_brindled_men_desc: "The maesters of Westeros write that the Sothoryi are no true men at all, but brutish creatures—huge of limb, brindled of skin, more hog than human. Their accounts speak of savagery, dark gods, cannibal feasts, and obscene rites. So say the learned, and so repeat the traders and pirates of the southern coasts, who treat the brindled folk as less than people. Yet such tales are stitched more from rumor and slander, rather than truth from, for the Sothoryi are indeed human, though strange to the foreigners. What is called savagery is often no more than the custom of a people little known and seldom understood." #NT!

 cos_yeen_ruins.1003.desc: "Beyond the nest proper is an uncanny hall utterly devoid of any webbing. In fact this area is devoid of any signs of living creatures at all. The passage opens up into a massive chamber, open to the air through a balcony on one side, overlooking the noble district. The walls, floor and ceiling are all carved with some sort of language here, dark colours swirling in the lettering. Out of the corner of your eye you can almost see them pulsing, but always remain seemingly inert once your focus is back on them.\n\nThe carvings are spotless and it's not long before you realise how that's possible. The walls are constantly oozing some sort of oily fluid at an extremely slow speed; almost imperceptable. This 'ichor' flows down through tiny gaps between the floors tiles to a destination unknown, sparing us from its buildup.\n\nAside from the fascinating walls, the room is unremarkable and bare. A few more minutes pass before anything else of significance is found as the vast chamber is searched. Claw marks... massive and unmistakably those of a dragon. There are scorch marks too, a region of the carvings blasted with dragon-flame; you'd heard that dragon fire, especially from a specimen of this size, would have turned cold stone to butter in moments, but this oily blackstone seems to have resisted the effect, if only somewhat...\n\nA final call of attention rings out across the echoing chamber. The ancient decayed remains of a campsite near the balcony. It looks as though its owner left in a hurry, leaving behind much of their camp, most notably #bold a luggage trunk of small Valyrian artifacts #! More exciting still, tucked away in a bundle at the bottom of a trunk is a large scaled egg. This must be the campsite of Jaenara Belaerys, making this egg that of the dragon Terrax!
