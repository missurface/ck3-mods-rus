 cm_dragonpit.0001.desc:0 "The Dragonpit has been constructed from the framework of the former Sept of Remembrance. The former center of worship in the city now stands ready to house the dragons of the realm. The arrival of dragons has heralded a renewed need for the pit to serve as the home to the beasts, far away from the peasantry of the city.\n\nAs apprehensive as lords and smallfolk alike are to the dragons, few are opposed to the construction of the Dragonpit, which now stands as a glorious monument to the power of the throne."

#  cowbook.1000.desc:0 "The five great towers of Harrenhal become visible to my armies miles away. Stretching up to the heavens, it is clear to all that this great city and its mighty keep can never be taken by men and siege weapons alone.\n\nAs my commanders report the fading morale of my soldiers, I remind them that the power of House Targaryen has never come from the men who carry our banners.\n\nAs I leave the war camp behind, I climb aboard Balerion and take flight. Flying high above the city, I know how to destroy this monument to the vanity of mortal men."
