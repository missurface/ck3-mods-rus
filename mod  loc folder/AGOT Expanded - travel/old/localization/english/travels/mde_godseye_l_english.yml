 mde_godseye.0001.t: "God's Eye"
 mde_godseye.0001.desc: "Riding up to the coast, an endless sight of calm water stretches before me. As the sun touches the lake, a faint shimmer of green and blue rises from its surface. Whether from the thick algae or the mirrored canopy of the surrounding forest, the God's Eye feels... different. Ancient.\n\nI sit astride my mount, lost in thought. Tales drift through my mind, tales of blood and fire, of old gods and darker things beneath still waters. A black swan drifts lazily near the reeds. Overhead, birds chirp, and soft waves lap against the shore.\n\nAnd now I face a choice. Do I linger and explore just a bit of this strange place, or do I press on?"
 mde_godseye.0001.a: "Rent a boat and crew and make for the island!"
 mde_godseye.0001.a.f: "Known to the maesters as the #italic 'Isle of Faces', it is sacred to the followers of [GetReligionByKey('the_pact_religion').GetName]. No one in living memory has visited the isle. If you choose this path, expect either an eerie welcome... or wrath."
 mde_godseye.0001.b: "Search the waters for mysteries."
 mde_godseye.0001.b.f: "The lake is no stranger to death. When Aegon the Conqueror set Harrenhal ablaze, stone and wall started to melt and explode. Later, Maegor the Cruel tore Prince Aegon and Quicksilver from the sky above this very lake. And in the songs, Aemond and Daemon Targaryen vanished into the waters; locked in death. Who knows what relics lie below?"
 mde_godseye.0001.c: "Move on."
 mde_godseye.0001.c.f: "The road calls. Some mysteries are best left to the depths."

 #isle

 mde_godseye.0011.t: "God's Eye: Isle of Faces"
 mde_godseye.0011.desc: "The low bog of the island #italic juts#! out as we approach, endless frozen roots swimming in and out of the lake. The isle is roofed in layers of green, yellow, and red leaves, blocking out the sky above. A thousand lost faces seem to watch us as we draw near.\n\nCriss-crossing the tangled mess, we reach what we assume is the shoreline, when a sudden hiss echoes across the island. A small dart #italic flicks#! through the air and strikes me in the neck.\n\nSuddenly, a wave of dizziness grips me, and I barely manage to stay upright."
 mde_godseye.0011.a: "#italic "Cowardice won't scare me away!"#!"
 mde_godseye.0011.b: "#italic "Get back on the water!"#!"
 
 
 mde_godseye.0012.desc: "My legs tremble as I step from the boat to the shore. I steady myself, lifting a hand to my head, but then, another #italic hiss#! echoes across the island… then a third, a fourth. The noise grows, a constant hissing now, growing and growing. No coming closer!\n\nPeering between the gnarled trunks and pale faces of the weirwoods, I catch one… #bold move#!.\n\nThen another sting. A second dart. And the world tilts. My vision blurs as the ground rushes up to meet me…"
 mde_godseye.0012.a: "..."
 
 mde_godseye.0013.desc: "The low bog of the island #italic juts#! out as we approach, endless frozen roots swimming in and out of the lake. The isle is roofed in layers of green, yellow, and red leaves, blocking out the sky above. A thousand lost faces seem to watch us as we draw near.\n\nThe small boat drifts gently onto the soft ground, and I step into the mud below, crushing old leaves and brittle branches with each step.\n\nMy travel companions refused to join me for this journey, and now even the hired boat crew balks at setting foot on the island. Alone, I push forward…"
 mde_godseye.0013.a: "Let's move on..."
 mde_godseye.0013.b: "Run back to the boat."

 mde_godseye.0014.desc: "As I circle around one of the many pale, bone-white weirwoods, I come upon a hooded figure kneeling beneath a carved face. I stop up and watch, as he slowly turns towards you…\n\n#italic “We knew you would come, we knew you would change your travel plans just to visit this location. The roots show all…”#!\n\nAs he speaks, birds begin to gather, first a raven, then a jay, then a dozen more, until the amount becomes #italic uncountable..#!\n\nMy vision narrows, drawn to the kneeling figure as he rises. #italic “Step forward now,”#! he whispers. #italic “Accept our gift.”#!"
 mde_godseye.0014.a: "#italic "I accept..."#!"
 mde_godseye.0014.b: "Return as fast as you can."

 mde_godseye.0015.desc: "Its mouth is frozen in a silent scream, the eyes carved deep and #X bleeding#! sap like weeping wounds. The red trails stretch down the trunk and into the mossy earth below. But it is the mouth that holds my gaze.\n\nWithin the gaping maw, something gleams. #bold Scales#!, a dragon? No... it cannot be.\n\n#italic "It is time,"#! the hooded figure says behind me, #italic "Time they returned to the world. You must be the one. It is your destiny."#!\n\nAnd now I see it clearly. Not a beast, but an egg. Smooth, gleaming, and impossibly whole. A dragon's egg, hidden within the roots of gods."
 mde_godseye.0015.a: "Finally...."
 mde_godseye.0015.b: "#italic "Dragons died for a reason!"#!"

 mde_godseye.0016.desc: "With the endless birds watching, with the frozen, weeping faces staring out from the trees, and with both sun and moon hanging in the sky, the hooded figure speaks:\n\n#italic “Your faith is well founded. <the pact> still holds power. Accept this gift, and defend the trees forevermore.”#!\n\nFrom the folds of his robe, he draws forth a bow, carved entirely of weirwood, its surface pale as bone and veined with red. It hums with quiet reverence, a weapon both sacred and strong."
 mde_godseye.0016.a: "#italic "Thank you..."#!"
 mde_godseye.0016.b: "#italic "This is too much."#!"

 mde_godseye.0017.desc: "I move closer, one step at a time. The hooded man shifts aside, revealing the weirwood face he had been kneeling before.\n\n#italic “Sit,”#! he whispers. #italic “Now you’ll become part of the roots too…”#!\n\nI sink to my knees, the earth damp and cold beneath me. I look up to the unblinking face in the tree…\n\nThe hooded figure continues: #italic “For this gift, you must join the roots. Dig your hands into the dirt. Feel the veins of the world… and #italic open your third eye.#!”#!"
 mde_godseye.0017.a: "Do as he says."
 mde_godseye.0017.a.f: "You will fall into a coma for prolonged period of time."
 mde_godseye.0017.b: "Run, run as fast as you can."

 mde_godseye.0018.desc: "Consciousness #X crashes#! over me like a #E wave#!. I gasp, lungs #XB burning#!, and I stagger forward on my knees. I’m on a shorefront. #italic The island?#! No, there, just ahead, a town.\n\nMy body trembles #X violently#! as I try to rise. My mind… My mind is #high full#!. Crowded with #instruction memories#! not my own; of dead kings, brave knights, humble smallfolk. I was with them. #italic I was them.#!\n\nI stumble forward, half-blind, each step a struggle. My vision fractures, I see five moments at once, until a voice cuts through the fog.\n\n#italic “MY [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]!”#! <name> yells out: #italic “We waited for you! it’s been weeks, what happened to you?!”#!"
 mde_godseye.0018.a: "My roots are deep..."
 mde_godseye.0018.b: "It was all a bad dream..."

 #lake
 
 mde_godseye.0021.t: "God's Eye: The lake"
 mde_godseye.0021.desc: "A punt boat is no stranger to the Riverlands. But on the God’s Eye, it’s a rare sight. The locals say the lakebed is so deep, only oars or sails can truly move a vessel across its dark waters.\n\nIt took some gold and a bit of charm, but I managed to rent a boat and hire a crew willing to test their luck on the lake. We push off, gliding out from the thick riparian weeds that choke the lake’s edge. Soon, we’re adrift in open water, algae and worse clinging to the surface like a sickly skin.\n\nEven with the sun high above, I can’t see more than a few feet into the depths. Whatever secrets this lake holds, they lie buried far below.\n\nWhat is my approach here?"
 mde_godseye.0021.a: "Bring the nets!"
 mde_godseye.0021.a.f: "We'll drag the lakebed, whatever rests down there, we’ll find it one way or another."
 mde_godseye.0021.b: "Clean the top!"
 mde_godseye.0021.b.f: "We’ll clear the surface muck, and send divers to search the shallows."
 mde_godseye.0021.c: "Investigate the deepest part."
 mde_godseye.0021.c.f: "Let’s take the boat out to the deepest waters. If there are answers, they lie where the lake swallows the light."

 mde_godseye.0022.desc: "A #bold splash#! rings out… one of the oarsmen has tossed a net overboard, and I watch as it drifts slowly into the dark below. The others follow suit, casting their nets one by one. The boat begins to drift, the lines trailing behind us like spider silk.\n\nI pace the deck as the sun crawls across the sky, shadows lengthening on the water’s surface. Time creeps by until, at last, the boat gives a sudden jolt. Halted, it seems, by the weight of the nets below. One by one, the crew begins to haul them up, sifting through what the lake has surrendered..."
 mde_godseye.0022.a: "Let's see what we find..."

 mde_godseye.0023.desc: "Even as the first net comes over the side, I know what awaits us… #bold nothing.#!\n\nThe notion that we might catch anything valuable in this vast, ancient lake was folly. When the nets spill out onto the deck, my suspicions are confirmed: fish, both dead and alive, stray weeds, and a stinking mess of lake wrack. \n\nWe pack up in silence and set sail back to shore. A waste of coin and time.y suspicion comes to reality, fish, both dead and alive, loose seaweed, and even wrack!"
 mde_godseye.0023.a: "Pack up and sail back to the shore."

 mde_godseye.0024.desc: "The thought of finding anything worthwhile seemed laughable… #italic Until now#!. As the nets are pulled up, out tumble not just fish and slime, but bits of glinting metal, rusted cutlery, and a scattering of old coins.\n\nNot a king’s ransom, perhaps, but enough to sell for a modest sum before we move on."
 mde_godseye.0024.a: "You sell it at the local town and move on."

 mde_godseye.0025.desc: "One net after another yields only lake rot and broken wood. But the last net resists. It takes every man aboard to haul it in, the rope groaning with strain.\n\nhen it finally breaches the waterline and lands on the deck with a heavy thump, we fall silent. #strong_glow A single large, oily and odd looking black stone#! sits patiently on deck."
 mde_godseye.0025.a: "Pack up and sail back to the shore."

 mde_godseye.0026.desc: "As the contents of each net are spilled onto the deck, the crew begins to sift through the tangled mess of lakeweed, bones, and rusted scrap.\n\nOne of the oarsmen strikes up #bold #italic ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’#!#!, and soon the others join in, their voices echoing over the still waters.\n\nThen, a sharp cry cuts through the chorus.\n\nI hurry toward the sound. One man kneels, eyes wide, hand trembling as he lifts something from the muck, blackened by time, but unmistakable in shape.\n\n #bold A crown.#! Lost to history… and now found again."
 mde_godseye.0026.a: "Pack up and sail back to the shore."

 mde_godseye.0027.desc: "I spot it just as the net breaks the surface, a stone too smooth, too oval to be natural.\n\nEven as it lands on the deck, #strong_glow glistening#! in the sun, I can't believe what I’m seeing. But the weight, the faint #x warmth#!… there’s no doubt."
 mde_godseye.0027.a: "A dragon egg, lost to the deep, now found."

 mde_godseye.0028.desc: "As the contents of each net are spilled onto the deck, the crew begins to sift through the tangled mess of lakeweed, bones, and rusted scrap.\n\nOne of the oarsmen strikes up #bold #italic ‘The Bear and the Maiden Fair’#!#!, and soon the others join in, their voices echoing over the still waters.\n\nUntil suddenly one cries out and interrupts the song. Blood flies out from a cut across his arm, I tell two oarsmen to bind him up, before I examine the nets content. Within it sits a blade lost to history, yet still #high sharp#!…"
 mde_godseye.0028.a: "Pack up and sail back to the shore."

 #nets death
 mde_godseye.0030.desc: "A #blod splash#! echoes across the lake… Not from the net, but from one of the oarsmen himself, slipping as he tosses the line and tumbling headfirst into the water.\n\nThe rest of the crew rush to the edge, shouting, pointing. For a moment, I can only watch as he thrashes and flails, sending up bursts of murky spray.\n\nThe water, thick with algae and darker things, swirls around him..."
 mde_godseye.0030.a: "#italic "Toss a rope to him! For [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FertilityGodName] sake!"#!"
 mde_godseye.0030.b: "Dive in and pull him up."
 mde_godseye.0030.c: "Let him save himself."
 #extra
 mde_godseye.0030.a.a: "You manage to pull him to safety"
 mde_godseye.0030.a.b: "The lake pulls you both down"
 mde_godseye.0030.b.success: "[ROOT.Char.GetUIName] saved the oarsman."
 mde_godseye.0030.b.failure: "The lake swallows your both."

 mde_godseye.0030.c.a: "He manage's to save himself"
 mde_godseye.0030.c.b: "The lake pulls him down"

 #divers
 mde_godseye.0031.desc: "Sailing along the edge of the lake, our local guide leads us to a stretch known for old wreckage. The oarsmen begin to sweep away the algae coating the surface, letting sunlight pierce through to the depths below.\n\nSuddenly, the oarsmen haul out a goat-skinned sack. With practiced ease, they swing it wildly, trapping air inside before tying the opening tightly around a narrow metal straw. Then, without a word, they slip into the water and vanish beneath the surface."
 mde_godseye.0031.a: "When they resurface, they bring along..."
 mde_godseye.0031.one: "The diver returns with nothing useless."
 mde_godseye.0031.two: "The diver returns with small trinkets!"
 mde_godseye.0031.three: "The diver returns with a lost crown!"
 mde_godseye.0031.four: "The diver returns with an Egg?!"
 mde_godseye.0031.five: "The diver returns with a sword?!"
