 hoare.0001.desc:0 "It has been 40 long years but now, my dream, my grand castle, the largest and strongest on the continent, Harrenhal, is complete. The final stone having been laid the same day that raven came from Dragonstone. \n \nBah! What a fool, my walls are impenetrable, House Hoare have been kings for thousands of years. It would be impossible for this 'Valyrian', the last of the spreaded ashes of the ancient empire to do as he says. Valyria is dead, I will piss on its ashes."

I have thousands of men outside your walls." #! \n \n #bold "What is outside my walls is of no concern to me"#! said Harren #bold "Those walls are strong and thick."#! \n \n #bold "But not so high as to keep out dragons.

 hoare.1002:0 "Aegon's Failure"
 hoare.1002.desc:0 "The Targaryen has failed! He is dead or has retreated to Dragonstone, his exact fate remains rumour for now. The would-be Conqueror will be remembered as a shame to his house. \n \nDeclaring himself 'King' of Westeros, what a fool, we crushed his armies and killed his people and yet he still refused to recognise that Harrenhal was unsiegable until the end. He was never going to make it past our walls."
 hoare.1002.option1:0 "The Kingdom of the Isles and Rivers stands."
