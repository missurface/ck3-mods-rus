 # THE CONQUEST
 durrandon.0001:0 "Argilac the Arrogant"
 durrandon.0001.desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen is an ambitious fool, his spat will see us both destroyed by Harren the Black as he finishes the construction of his monstrous Harrenhal. \n \nBut there is no turning back, the Lord of Dragonstone will face me in battle and I will kill him. And his bastard brother too."
 durrandon.0001.option1:0 "Ours is the Fury."

 durrandon.0002:0 "Aegon's Landing"
 durrandon.0002.desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen has landed on the northside of the mouth of the Blackwater rush, he must mean to attack Harrenhal first. He is Harren's problem, the Ironborn can deal with him while we watch and prepare. \n \nThe Targaryen's will have no clue what we have awaiting them, they have dragons but dragons have never beaten Stormlanders!"
 durrandon.0002.option1:0 "House Durrandon has stood since Durran Godsgrief!"

 durrandon.0003:0 "Aegon's Invaison of the Stormlands"
 durrandon.0003.desc:0 "The Targaryen lord and his sisters have defeated their initial competition, their dragons laid waste to their armies but they were fools with no true armies. \n \nNow Aegon advances towards us, he will see the error of his ambition and surrender his claims as 'King of All Westeros'."
 durrandon.0003.option1:0 "We will crush them!"

 durrandon.0004:0 "Orys Baratheon Spotted in Battle"
 durrandon.0004.desc:0 "Our warhorses panicked and fled in terror, crashing into riders behind them, and turning the charge into chaos. I myself was thrown from my saddle. Yet still I continued to battle. When Orys Baratheon came down the muddy hill with his own men, he found me holding off half a dozen men, with as many corpses at his feet. \n \n#bold “Stand aside,” #!Baratheon commanded. He dismounted, so as to meet the king on equal footing, and offered the Storm King one last chance to yield. Argilac cursed him instead. And so they fought, the old warrior king with his streaming white hair and Aegon’s fierce, black-bearded Hand. \n \nThe bastard will die!"
 durrandon.0004.option1:0 "Ours is the Fury!"

 durrandon.0005:0 "The Bastard is Dead!"
 durrandon.0005.desc:0 "I have killed Orys Baratheon, the bastard brother of Aegon Targaryen lay dead at my feet. He certainly won't be having my daughter's hand now! We must recollect our forces and press this advantage. This 'Conquest' will be stopped here, in its tracks!"
 durrandon.0005.option1:0 "To victory!"

 durrandon.1001:0 "Aegon's Failure"
 durrandon.1001.desc:0 "The Targaryen has failed! He is dead or has retreated to Dragonstone, his exact fate remains rumour for now. The would-be Conqueror will be remembered as a shame to his house. \n \nDeclaring himself 'King' of Westeros, what a fool, there was no way he was ever going to secure such a title."
 durrandon.1001.option1:0 "Dragon are no threat to Westeros."
