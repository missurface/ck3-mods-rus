 riverlords.0001:0 "Aegon's Conquest of the Riverlands"
 riverlords.0001.desc:0 "The Riverlands has been under brutal occupation of the Ironborn for the better part of a century, Harren the Black has destroyed the Riverlands in his construction of Harrenhal. That monstrous castle has been under construction for forty years. \n \nAnd now another occupier has come to take his place but this time from the east. However, the Valyrian's have a reputation to be a lenient overlord, not pressing on the cultures or faith of other regions. Perhaps, joining Aegon, we could insipre the other Riverlords to raise in rebellion. \n \nThe dragon or the drowned god?"
 riverlords.0001.option1:0 "Family, Duty, Honour... freedom. We stand with Aegon."
 riverlords.0001.option2:0 "We'll wait it out, bend the knee to the victor."

Lord Tully has declared for Aegon, if the Riverlands move with him we will certainly be in a favourable position.  \n \nThe dragon or the drowned god?"
 riverlords.0002.option1:0 "We shall no longer be Ironborn slaves."

 riverlords.0003:0 "Lord Paramount of the Trident"
 riverlords.0003.desc:0 "King Aegon is victorious and he sees the leadership I have given the Riverlords in our rebellion. \n \nAs such, he has decided to grant me the title of Lord Paramount of the Trident, alongside the fealty of all the Riverlords from the Cape of Eagles to Maidenpool. \n \nOur gambit has paid off."
 riverlords.0003.option1:0 "All hail King Aegon the Dragon."

 riverlords.0004:0 "House Qoherys, Lords of Harrenhal"
 riverlords.0004.desc:0 "House Qoherys have served the Targaryen's on Dragonstone ever since before the Doom of Valyria. We were one of the few families that travelled with them and escaped death. \n \nI served as Aegon Targaryen's Master-at-Arms for many years but to be offered Harrenhal, the greatest castle in Westeros as a payment for this duty is far greater a gift than I had anticipated. \n \nWe must now serve the Targaryen's here and establish my house as truly one of note."
 riverlords.0004.option1:0 "We serve the Dragon."
