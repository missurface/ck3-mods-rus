My mastery of Bloodmagic has allowed me to create a facsimile of the royal blood of Dawn. A small part of the Emperess' splendour has reawakened within me and now links me to her royal bloodline. My work however is far from done, for now, my godhood is still in its infancy. I will have to nurture my powers even further to reach true Divinity."
