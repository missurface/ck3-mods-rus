Their accounts speak of savagery, dark gods, cannibal feasts, and obscene rites. So say the learned, and so repeat the traders and pirates of the southern coasts, who treat the brindled folk as less than people. Yet such tales are stitched more from rumor and slander, rather than truth from, for the Sothoryi are indeed human, though strange to the foreigners. What is called savagery is often no more than the custom of a people little known and seldom understood."

The jungle has however, yet to reclaim a few districts of the city; those bearing columns of an oily black stone in their centres.\n\nRestoring Zamettar would be an exceptionally difficult task, but with enough time, effort and gold, this city could once again sprawl as far as the Zamoyos Delta itself."

There are no obstructing vines or roots, just plenty of loose earth; a weather-worn city, eerie and silent and forboring alltogether.\n\nThough all previous attempts to inhabit this place have ended in horror... Surely such a thing cannot happen again. After all, compared to the vicious jungles of deep Sothoryos, Yeen seems a remarkably safe haven."

 cos_swamp_wyvern_bonding_title:0 "Luring a Leviathan - The Great Swamp"
 cos_swamp_wyvern_bonding_desc:0 "The wyverns that call the Great Swamp their home are extremely territorial creatures. Constantly vying against their neighbors for greater swathes of the sodden ground to call their own. Approaching the territory of one such beast will almost certainly end in disaster, as their lethal beaks and tails make short work of any non-wyvern foe.\n\nHowever, as they grow into a more venerable age, the swamp wyverns become lazier and more docile; more accepting to offerings from man. If done well, the beast can grow dependant on their providers, eventually becoming willing to follow direction towards new sources of 'food'. Whether or not that food happens to be other, more hostile tribespeople is irrelevant to the beast.\n\nSeveral scouts have returned and one steps forward to speak: "Three have been found. How many can we afford to feed?""

In this state the alpha appears almost 20 meters (~60ft) in width and its siluette against the sky sends a shiver down my spine. Its claws are sharp, its beak sharper. I have but a single moment now to make my move..."

 cos_yeen_ruins.1003.t:0 "The Weeping Halls"
 cos_yeen_ruins.1003.desc:0 "Beyond the nest proper is an uncanny hall utterly devoid of any webbing. In fact this area is devoid of any signs of living creatures at all. The passage opens up into a massive chamber, open to the air through a balcony on one side, overlooking the noble district. The walls, floor and ceiling are all carved with some sort of language here, dark colours swirling in the lettering. Out of the corner of your eye you can almost see them pulsing, but always remain seemingly inert once your focus is back on them.\n\nThe carvings are spotless and it's not long before you realise how that's possible. The walls are constantly oozing some sort of oily fluid at an extremely slow speed; almost imperceptable. This 'ichor' flows down through tiny gaps between the floors tiles to a destination unknown, sparing us from its buildup.\n\nAside from the fascinating walls, the room is unremarkable and bare. A few more minutes pass before anything else of significance is found as the vast chamber is searched. Claw marks... massive and unmistakably those of a dragon. There are scorch marks too, a region of the carvings blasted with dragon-flame; you'd heard that dragon fire, especially from a specimen of this size, would have turned cold stone to butter in moments, but this oily blackstone seems to have resisted the effect, if only somewhat...\n\nA final call of attention rings out across the echoing chamber. The ancient decayed remains of a campsite near the balcony. It looks as though its owner left in a hurry, leaving behind much of their camp, most notably #bold a luggage trunk of small Valyrian artifacts #! More exciting still, tucked away in a bundle at the bottom of a trunk is a large scaled egg. This must be the campsite of Jaenara Belaerys, making this egg that of the dragon Terrax! You pray that ages in this evil place have not effected the egg in some way..."
