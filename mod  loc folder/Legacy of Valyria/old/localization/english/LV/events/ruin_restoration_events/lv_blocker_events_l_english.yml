  # Descriptions
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.unexplored_caves:0 "After long weeks beneath the earth, the last torchbearers have returned. The tunnels have been mapped, the dangers marked, and the unknown brought into the light. Where once only darkness and dread lay, there are now charts, camps, and the beginnings of roads. No longer a haunt of whispers and broken bones, the caverns stand tamed—claimed by those with the will to delve.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.swamp:0 "What was once a mire of rot and ruin has been made passable. The swamp, long a haven for biting insects, sinking feet, and whispered disappearances, has been drained and tamed—if such a thing is possible. Raised paths now wind through ground once too treacherous to tread, and the choking fog has thinned with each felled tree and turned stone. It is no longer a place of death and decay, but one of hard-won order. A new foundation, carved from muck and madness.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.floods:0 "The waters have finally receded. What once lay drowned beneath churning tides and sodden earth is now revealed—ruined roads, broken walls, and sodden fields, yes, but also dry land and the chance to rebuild. Dikes and drainage channels have been carved, embankments raised, and stone laid down where mud once ruled. It is still wet country, but it is no longer helpless. The flood has been turned back, if only for a time.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.noxious_gases:0 "The air has cleared at last. What once hung heavy with death—choking fumes and bitter haze—has begun to thin. Vent shafts have been carved, ash swept away, and the land given time to breathe. The stench of sulfur still lingers, faint but no longer fatal. The mountain still smolders in the distance, a quiet warning, but its poison no longer grips the land. The worst has passed... for now.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.stonemen:0 "It is done. The stonemen are gone—driven out, put to the sword, or left to slip silently beneath the river’s black waters. They had no hope, no cure, and no future. Twisted by greyscale and half-mad with pain and hunger, they had become a danger to all who passed near. Still, it was not easy. Some remembered their names. Others begged for death in a tongue too broken to understand. Now, only silence lingers where they once huddled. The land is safer. But something colder has taken root in the air.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.bandit_camps:0 "The camp has been broken. Tents torn down, fires smothered, and blood soaked into the dirt. The bandits fought like the desperate men they were—ragged, brutal, with no illusions of mercy. But your men stood firm. What few outlaws survived fled into the wilds, scattered and wounded. For now, the roads are quieter, and the people may breathe a little easier. Justice—harsh, bloody, and overdue—has been done.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.small_ruined_holding:0 "Stone and silence—these were all that remained when you first arrived. Now, the overgrowth has been cut back, the broken walls examined, and the last dangers cleared. What once was a hollow shell of a holding now stands ready to serve again. There is still much work to be done, but its bones are strong. Whether forgotten by lords or abandoned to time, this place will not be lost again.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.medium_ruined_holding:0 "It took time—and blood—but the ruin stands cleared. Crumbling towers have been surveyed, unstable halls shored up, and what dangers still lingered within have been driven out or buried for good. Once a husk of lost purpose, the holding now stands ready to serve once more. It may never reclaim all its past glories, but the land has been reclaimed, and the old stones rise with new intent.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.large_ruined_holding:0 "The ruin loomed vast and quiet, steeped in memory older than maps. Its walls, broken but still defiant, bore the scars of conquest, fire, and time itself. Yet even these stones could be tamed. After long toil and careful effort, the site is secured—its crumbling arches stabilized, its forgotten depths purged of danger. Though the ghosts of fallen empires still seem to whisper through the wind-worn halls, the ruin no longer lies abandoned. A new chapter begins upon these old bones.\n\n"

  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.unexplored_caves.dragon_egg:0 "Yet in the depths of these caves, a discovery awaits. Amidst the rubble and dust lies a [dragon|E] egg, its shell shimmering faintly in the dim light. A relic of a bygone age, it holds within it the promise of rebirth and power."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.swamp.dragon_egg:0 "Amid the muck and stone, buried in roots older than memory, something was found—smooth as riverstone, yet warm to the touch. A [dragon|E]’s egg, or so the whispers say. Cracked legends tell of such relics left behind in the days of [valyria|E], lost in fire or swallowed by the earth. That one should surface here, in the heart of a forgotten swamp, is a tale few will believe. But those who’ve seen it know: the world just shifted."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.floods.dragon_egg:0 "Among the muck and debris left behind by the flood, something wholly unexpected was uncovered: smooth, scaled, and faintly warm. A [dragon|E]’s egg. Whether lost in some ancient cataclysm or buried in haste during the fall of [old_valyria|E], none can say. But the stories are clear—such things are not merely relics. They are promise, and peril."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.noxious_gases.dragon_egg:0 "In the cracked basin of a scorched ravine, buried beneath layers of cooled ash and volcanic stone, something strange was unearthed—an egg, dark and veined, pulsing faintly with heat. A [dragon|E]’s egg, by all accounts. How it came to rest there none can say, but in the shadow of fire-mountains, such relics are not so easily dismissed as myth. The blood of the old world stirs again."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.stonemen.dragon_egg:0 "In the heart of the stonemen’s camp, where ash and stone mingled, a strange relic was uncovered. An egg, dark and veined, pulsing faintly with heat. A [dragon|E]’s egg, perhaps left by a fleeing lord or buried in haste during the fall of [valyria|E]. Its presence here is no accident. A remnant of fire, sleeping beneath ash."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.bandit_camps.dragon_egg:0 "Beneath the collapsed hearthstone of the old great hall, your men uncovered something strange—oval, stone-like, and faintly warm to the touch. A [dragon|E]’s egg. Perhaps left by a fleeing Valyrian noble, or buried in secret during the Doom. Whatever its origin, its presence here is no accident. A remnant of fire, sleeping beneath ash."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.small_ruined_holding.dragon_egg:0 "In the ruins of what may once have been a vault or shrine, buried beneath scorched rubble and timeworn sigils, a strange relic was uncovered: smooth, oval, and pulsing faintly with heat. A [dragon|E]’s egg, though none could say how old, or why it lay hidden. A relic of a forgotten lineage—or something older still. The ruin held more than stone."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.medium_ruined_holding.dragon_egg:0 "In the depths of the old keep, behind walls long thought collapsed, a strange relic was found—an egg, dark and veined, pulsing faintly with heat. A [dragon|E]’s egg, perhaps left by a fleeing lord or buried in haste during the fall of [valyria|E]. Its presence here is no accident. A remnant of fire, sleeping beneath ash."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.large_ruined_holding.dragon_egg:0 "Far beneath the crumbled spires, your men unearthed a chamber untouched by sunlight. Within, surrounded by scorched stone and faded glyphs, lay a single egg—glossy, veined, and warm to the touch. Whether left behind in haste or sealed away with purpose, it has endured the fall of empires and the silence of centuries. Now, it is yours. A relic of [dragons_plural|E], sleeping in the dark."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.unexplored_caves.gold_high:0 "The caverns, once a place of darkness and dread, have yielded their secrets. When the last torchbearers came back, they brought with them not just tales of danger, but also treasures beyond imagination. Gold and gems, hidden from even the [dragonlords|El]' sights, now lie in the light of day. A fitting reward for clearing out the depths."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.swamp.gold_high:0 "The work was meant only to drain the land and raise firm paths—but fortune has a mind of its own. Beneath a collapsed stone altar, deep in the heart of the mire, the diggers struck gold. Chests sealed tight with rusted iron, coins stamped with old Valyrian faces, and ornaments lost to centuries of rot and root. No one can say how it came to be buried in such a place—some whisper of fleeing [dragonlords|El], others of bandits who never escaped their own trap. Whatever its origin, the hoard is real. And now, it is yours."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.floods.gold_high:0 "As the floodwaters withdrew, they left more than silt and ruin behind. Tucked into a ruined cellar or half-buried beneath fallen stone, a vast hoard was uncovered—gold coins by the hundred, finework jewelry, and artifacts of forgotten make. A fortune, by any measure. Enough to rebuild, expand, or tempt the envy of distant lords."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.noxious_gases.gold_high:0 "Amid the blackened ruins and seared stone, a vault was found—its locks warped by heat but unbroken. Within, gold gleamed undimmed by ash or time. Coin, ingot, and ornament, more than most lords could claim, untouched by fire but hidden for generations. Whether hoarded by [dragonlords|El] or buried in haste before the mountain’s wrath, it now belongs to you."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.stonemen.gold_high:0 "In the heart of the stonemen’s camp, where ash and stone mingled, a hidden cache was uncovered. Gold coins, tarnished but intact, and relics of craftsmanship long lost to time. Perhaps left behind by a fleeing lord or buried in haste during the fall of [valyria|E]. Whatever its origin, it is a treasure worth claiming—a reward for those who dared to face the curse."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.bandit_camps.gold_high:0 "As your men pried open the hidden vault beneath the bandits’ camp, the glint of gold flooded the chamber—chests overflowing with stolen coin, gilded trinkets, and merchant finery. But celebration came too soon. Footsteps echo in the gloom. From the treeline, shadows gather—bandits not yet slain, driven by desperation and vengeance. The gold is within reach, but one final fight remains, and it will be vicious."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.small_ruined_holding.gold_high:0 "Hidden in a sealed cellar, behind walls half-collapsed with time, lay a forgotten vault. Within: coin by the chestful, old gold bearing sigils faded by dust, and relics of value long removed from memory. Perhaps the treasury of a house lost to war or exile. Now, it is yours—a treasure great enough to reshape plans and settle debts alike."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.medium_ruined_holding.gold_high:0 "The lower levels of the ruin, thought collapsed, concealed more than dust. Hidden chambers behind false walls revealed a fortune—coin marked by long-dead houses, goblets of silver, and heirlooms untouched by light for decades. The vault was likely sealed in haste, left behind in war or exile. Its rediscovery now is a reward not just for persistence, but for survival."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.large_ruined_holding.gold_high:0 "Beneath the central plaza, sealed by stone too thick to breach without months of work, an ancient treasury revealed itself. Coins older than the Faith, crowns of empires long extinguished, and gilded statuary carved in styles unseen for generations. It is a fortune not just in weight, but in wonder—a tangible remnant of the world that was. A treasure to rival the greatest hoards of the [dragonlords|El], now yours to claim."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.unexplored_caves.gold_low:0 "The caverns held more than just shadows. Among the winding passages, a small trove was uncovered—coins dulled by time, and a scattering of gems nestled in ancient stone. Not enough to rouse a king’s envy, but enough to glimmer with promise. A worthy prize for those bold enough to brave the deep."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.swamp.gold_low:0 "In the clearing of muck and mire, something glinted beneath the roots. A modest hoard—no king’s ransom, but enough to catch the breath. Scattered coins, a tarnished goblet, the remnants of wealth long ago hidden or forgotten. Perhaps the spoils of a fleeing lord, or the final tribute of a doomed caravan. Whatever its story, the gold is real, and it now lines your coffers—a quiet reward for hard, dirty work."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.floods.gold_low:0 "It wasn’t much, at least not at first glance—a pouch of old coin wedged in the beams of a collapsed storehouse, a few scattered ingots hidden beneath fallen stone. Still, it’s a welcome find. Modest though it may be, it’s enough to steady uncertain hands and fund the first steps of recovery."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.noxious_gases.gold_low:0 "Not all riches are grand. Tucked beneath collapsed rock and scorched debris, a modest hoard came to light—some coins fused together, a singed chest half-consumed by fire. Yet enough remained to matter. A quiet boon, pulled from the ashes of what was nearly lost."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.stonemen.gold_low:0 "Among the ruins of the stonemen’s camp, a small cache was found—coins, tarnished but intact, and a few trinkets that survived the decay. It is not a fortune, but it is enough to remind those who remain that even in the darkest places, hope can be found. A small reward for a grim task."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.bandit_camps.gold_low:0 "Tucked beneath a rotted floorboard, your men uncovered a small stash of plunder—scattered coin, a silver ring, a goblet dented from travel. Enough to matter, but not enough to gloat. As they began to pack the spoils, movement stirred in the underbrush. The last of the bandits, ragged and howling, surge forward in a final, savage attempt to reclaim what’s theirs. One more clash looms."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.small_ruined_holding.gold_low:0 "Among the shattered remnants of a steward’s chamber, your men uncovered a modest stash—bags of coin, a few rings, and tools of old craftsmanship tucked beneath the floorboards. Enough to be called a reward, if not a windfall. It seems even the humblest ruins may still cling to their past."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.medium_ruined_holding.gold_low:0 "Among the wreckage of an old solar, your men uncovered a small, sealed coffer—its iron hinges rusted, but its contents intact. Modest, but meaningful: coin, a few pieces of jewelry, and a narrow ledger too faded to read. Perhaps the final belongings of a castellan who never returned. Whatever the story, its value endures."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.desc.large_ruined_holding.gold_low:0 "Tucked behind a collapsed wall in what may once have been a noble’s estate, your men discovered a long-sealed cache: a modest collection of jewelry, old coin, and ceremonial items likely hidden in the chaos of downfall. Though humble compared to the grandeur of the ruin itself, it is a valuable fragment of the past—and proof that even great cities were made by human hands."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0001.a:0 "Excellent!"

  ## Swamp: Challenge Event
  lv_blocker_clearance.0011.t:0 "Taming the Marsh"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0011.desc:0 "The swamp has been drained, its wild terrain partially subdued—but one final effort remains to fully reclaim the land. Embankments must be reinforced, channels redirected, and new foundations laid with care. A single misstep could see the mire return, swallowing months of effort.\n\nThe people look to you—or to your steward—for direction. If this last phase is managed well, the swamp will be conquered. If not, the waters may rise again."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0011.a:0 "I will overseer the final phase myself."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0011.b:0 "Let my steward manage the details."

  # Swamp: Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0012.t:0 "Sinking Efforts"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0012.desc:0 "Despite your team's best efforts, the swamp resists all attempts at taming. Foundations slip, workers vanish into muck, and hastily built platforms rot in days. The land reclaims what little was gained, and progress slinks backward into the mire. It is not a complete loss—but it feels close."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0012.a:0 "The swamp is more stubborn than we thought. We’ll try again."

  # Swamp: Critical Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0013.t:0 "Swallowed by the Mire"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0013.desc:0 "Everything collapsed. Whole structures vanished beneath the bog, and a miscalculated drainage channel flooded vital ground. Teams scattered, tools were lost, and the swamp thickened with every misstep. All that had been achieved is now undone—the land is once more a treacherous, sinking morass. You'll need to start from the beginning."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0013.a:0 "It’s all gone. The swamp has devoured our work."

  # Swamp: Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0014.t:0 "Firm Ground at Last"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0014.desc:0 "With steady hands and careful planning, the swamp has been subdued. Canals have been dug, supports reinforced, and dry land begins to form where once there was only mud and decay. It will take time to build upon it—but for now, the danger is gone. The mire has been made manageable."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0014.a:0 "It was hard-won, but the ground is ours now."

  # Swamp: Critical Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0015.t:0 "The Marsh Transformed"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0015.desc:0 "A masterstroke. The final phase of the effort unfolded perfectly—no missteps, no setbacks. The land dried faster than expected, revealing stable ground and even the remains of long-lost structures beneath the mud. Among the rotted posts and sunken stone, something glinted—a sealed chest, untouched by time, now freed from the swamp’s grip."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0015.a:0 "The swamp is cleared—and the mire gave us something in return."

  ## Floods: Challenge Event
  lv_blocker_clearance.0021.t:0 "The Mire Yields"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0021.desc:0 "The floodwaters have mostly receded, leaving behind sodden ground and the fragile beginnings of recovery. Yet unless the rivers are tamed and the land properly drained, all progress may be lost. Ditches must be dug, levees strengthened, and the people guided with purpose—before the next rain undoes everything.\n\nThe work demands a steady hand and a clear mind. Whether by your command or your steward’s, this final effort will decide whether the land is reclaimed—or drowned once more."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0021.a:0 "I will beat back the floods."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0021.b:0 "My steward will finish what was started."

  # Floods: Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0022.t:0 "The Waters Rise Again"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0022.desc:0 "Efforts to redirect the floodwaters have faltered. Makeshift levees broke under pressure, and drainage plans proved insufficient. While some headway had been made, it’s now clear the flooding has resumed its slow advance, undoing recent progress. Fields drown again, and spirits sink alongside them."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0022.a:0 "We underestimated the waters. We'll try again, better prepared."
  
  # Floods: Critical Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0023.t:0 "Swept Away"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0023.desc:0 "A complete collapse. Rains returned with force, and the flood defenses crumbled in disarray. Channels overflowed, bridges collapsed, and entire sections of reclaimed land were lost. The terrain is once again choked by silt and water, and any gains made have been washed away. The land has reclaimed what was taken—now it must all be done again."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0023.a:0 "This was a disaster... We'll have to start from the beginning."

  # Floods: Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0024.t:0 "The Waters Recede"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0024.desc:0 "After tireless work, the last of the floodwaters has been pushed back. Dikes hold firm, diverted streams find their course, and sodden ground begins to dry under the returning sun. There’s still much rebuilding to do, but the danger has passed, and the land is yours once more."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0024.a:0 "Finally, the floods are behind us."

  # Floods: Critical Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0025.t:0 "Taming the Waters"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0025.desc:0 "Not only was the flood held at bay—it was mastered. Brilliant redirection of water, swift labor, and shrewd planning have not only dried the land but reshaped it. Former marshes are now fertile lowlands. And in the exposed riverbed, something ancient was uncovered—a trove buried and forgotten, now brought to light by the departing waters."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0025.a:0 "The waters retreat—and they leave behind a gift."

  ## Noxious Gases: Challenge Event
  lv_blocker_clearance.0031.t:0 "Sealing the Vapors"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0031.desc:0 "The worst of the fumes have thinned, but the land is not yet safe. Poisonous gases still rise from deep vents or cling to low ground, invisible and deadly. Final containment must be handled with precision—diverting flow, sealing fissures, and perhaps building channels to disperse what lingers.\n\nA single miscalculation could release it all again. You may oversee this effort yourself, or entrust the task to your steward. Either way, this is the final barrier between ruin and renewal."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0031.a:0 "I'll manage this personally. It must be done right."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0031.b:0 "I'll entrust the containment to my steward."

  # Noxious Gases: Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0032.t:0 "The Vapors Rise Again"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0032.desc:0 "The work to seal off the last of the noxious vents has faltered. Whether by poor judgment, misaligned barriers, or simply the volatile nature of the land itself, the gases have begun to rise once more. Sickened workers stumble from the mist, and the stench clings to the air like a curse.\n\nProgress has been undone, and the area grows hazardous once more. While not a complete collapse, the setback is clear—and costly.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0032.desc.illness.self:0 "As the fumes thickened once more, you were caught in the worst of it. The taste of metal clings to your mouth, and your lungs feel scorched. Days have passed, yet the illness remains—a cruel reminder of how close you stood to danger."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0032.desc.illness.councillor:0 "In the chaos of the failed effort, your steward took the brunt of the exposure. They now lie abed, skin clammy and breath short, their recovery uncertain. The hazard remains—and now one of your own pays the price."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0032.a:0 "We miscalculated. We'll try again—more carefully this time."

  # Noxious Gases: Critical Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0033.t:0 "Choking On Our Aspirations"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0033.desc:0 "Disaster. What was meant to be the final containment effort has gone catastrophically wrong. A sealed fissure burst open with a roar, flooding the area with choking fumes. Workers collapsed where they stood. Livestock perished. Even the wind itself seemed to turn traitor, carrying the poison further than before.\n\nWhatever gains had been made are now gone. The land lies smothered once more in thick, suffocating gas. Clearing it again will require time, caution—and no small measure of luck."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0033.a:0 "We've failed utterly..."

  # Noxious Gases: Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0034.t:0 "The Air Clears"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0034.desc:0 "The final efforts have succeeded. Fissures have been sealed, vents diverted, and the last traces of the choking fumes have faded. The air, once thick with poison, now carries the clean scent of open wind and distant rain. Crops may grow, livestock may return—and people dare to breathe deeply once again.\n\nThrough diligence, planning, and no small effort, the land has been reclaimed from the unseen killer. The danger is gone. For now, at least.\n\n"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0034.desc.illness.self:0 "Yet not all victories come without cost. You emerged from the operation successful, but the time spent near the foul vapors has left its mark. A cough that won’t quite go away. Dizziness that lingers longer than it should. The land is safe... but you are not untouched."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0034.desc.illness.councillor:0 "Though the operation ended in success, your steward did not escape unscathed. Exposure to the fumes has left them pale and unsteady, their voice weaker than before. They insist they’ll recover in time—but their sacrifice won’t be forgotten."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0034.a:0 "The air is clear at last."

  # Noxious Gases: Critical Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0035.t:0 "A Windfall in the Mists"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0035.desc:0 "The final phase went smoother than even the boldest dared hope. The vents were sealed without incident, the air cleared in record time, and the land seemed to exhale in relief. Yet fortune held more than just clean air in store. While surveying the area one last time, your workers unearthed something long hidden beneath the poisoned earth—an ancient vault, sealed and forgotten, preserved by the very fumes that once made this place deadly.\n\nThe hazard is gone, and in its place... a windfall waits."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0035.a:0 "The air clears—and reveals riches buried in the mist."

  ## Stonemen: Challenge Event
  lv_blocker_clearance.0041.t:0 "The Last of the Stonemen"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0041.desc:0 "The stonemen have been driven back, but their presence still lingers at the fringes—caves, ruins, and broken shelters where the sick and desperate huddle in silence. To fully clear the encampment, the area must be swept, quarantined, and sealed. It is not only a matter of sword and fire, but of structure and order.\n\nIf the work is mishandled, the afflicted may return—and the curse will spread anew. Will you take charge of the purge, or place your trust in your marshal's precision?"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0041.a:0 "I will see this blight ended myself."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0041.b:0 "My marshal will coordinate the final sweep."

  # Stonemen: Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0042.t:0 "The Curse Lingers"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0042.desc:0 "The operation faltered. Routes were blocked, supplies ran thin, and when the final push came, the stonemen scattered into the mire and ruins. Too many escaped the cordon, and the camp still festers beyond reach. Their presence remains a danger, and worse—those who ventured too close now eye strange spots on their skin."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0042.a:0 "They slipped through our fingers. We must prepare anew."

  # Stonemen: Critical Failure
  lv_blocker_clearance.0043.t:0 "Touched by Stone"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0043.desc:0 "Disaster struck. The advance party was overrun, and several men were dragged into the infected camp, never to be seen again. Others fled in terror, and the surviving stonemen, emboldened, now range further than before. The disease spreads. Patrols report sightings closer to the settlements. The entire effort has failed, and worse—its consequences now spread outward."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0043.a:0 "We’ve made it worse. The stone spreads unchecked."

  # Stonemen: Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0044.t:0 "The Curse Contained"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0044.desc:0 "Through discipline, careful planning, and grim resolve, the encampment has been cleared. Fires purged what could not be saved, and no infected were left to wander. The area still bears scars of sickness and sorrow—but the threat is gone. The land may heal now, slowly and cautiously."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0044.a:0 "It is done. Let no stone remain standing."

  # Stonemen: Critical Success
  lv_blocker_clearance.0045.t:0 "A Swift and Clean End"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0045.desc:0 "The operation was swift, decisive, and miraculously clean. The afflicted were driven out or destroyed with minimal resistance, and even the terrain worked in your favor—natural channels hemmed them in, and no one who ventured in fell ill. As the final ashes cooled, your scouts uncovered a sealed crypt beneath the ruins, long undisturbed. A relic from before the fall, spared by isolation... and now in your hands."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0045.a:0 "A clean victory—and an unexpected prize beneath the ash."

  ## Bandit Camps: Challenge Event
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.t:0 "Breaking the Last Blade"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.desc:0 "The camp lies in ruins, but banditry is a weed that regrows quickly. Scattered survivors may regroup, strike back, or vanish into the hills to return another day. To truly end their hold, the land must be brought to heel: roads resecured, defenses raised, and order restored.\n\nThis is no longer a battle, but a test of control. Whether you see it through yourself, or delegate to your steward, this final effort will determine if the region falls back into lawlessness—or finally knows peace."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.a:0 "I will crush the last of the bandits myself."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.b:0 "My marshal will drive them out with steel and fire."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.c:0 "Let me speak with them—there may yet be a peaceful end."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0051.d:0 "Send my chancellor. Perhaps they’ll listen to reason."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0052.t.diplomacy:0 "Talks Collapse"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0052.desc.martial:0 "The attack met stiff resistance. The terrain favored the bandits—thick brush and hidden trails gave them the edge. Your forces were pushed back, bloodied and frustrated. Though some ground was gained, the camp remains active, its banners still waving in defiance."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0052.desc.diplomacy:0 "Your envoy made contact—but the bandits were divided, suspicious, and unwilling to parley in good faith. Negotiations dragged, then soured, ending with threats and drawn blades. The outlaws remain entrenched, and may be even more wary of your next move."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0052.a.martial:0 "We’ll regroup. Next time, we crush them."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0052.a.diplomacy:0 "We tried reason. We'll find another way."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0053.t.diplomacy:0 "A Knife Behind the Smile"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0053.desc.martial:0 "It was a trap. The bandits anticipated your every move. Archers rained death from hidden ridges, and fire was set to your supply lines. The attack collapsed, and your forces fled in chaos. Worse—rumors spread of your weakness, and more outlaws gather in the hills. You’ve not only failed—you’ve emboldened them."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0053.desc.diplomacy:0 "It was all a ruse. While your envoy spoke, others circled the camp—and were attacked without warning. One of your agents was killed, another vanished. The bandits laughed as your men limped away. Any goodwill is gone, and the outlaws now treat diplomacy as weakness. The entire effort is undone."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0053.a.martial:0 "They were waiting for us. We'll need to start over—and harder than before."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0053.a.diplomacy:0 "We were fools to trust them. Back to square one."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0054.desc.martial:0 "Steel and discipline won the day. Your soldiers stormed the encampment, routing the bandits and burning their hovels to ash. The threat has been quelled. Though a few stragglers may escape into the wilds, the region is finally at peace—for now."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0054.desc.diplomacy:0 "After tense days of negotiation, an agreement was reached. Some of the bandits accepted offers of pardon, others took coin to leave. A few vanished into the woods, but the camp itself has emptied. There may yet be more out there—but this threat, at least, has passed peacefully."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0054.a.martial:0 "Let that be the end of it."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0054.a.diplomacy:0 "A quiet end, without blood. Let’s hope it lasts."

  lv_blocker_clearance.0055.t.diplomacy:0 "Outlaws Turned Allies"
  lv_blocker_clearance.0055.desc.martial:0 "A flawless campaign. The attack was swift, overwhelming, and left no bandit alive to warn another. Among the plundered loot, your men uncovered a buried chest—spoils from a noble caravan lost months ago, now yours by right of conquest. The camp is gone, and the bandits’ greed has paid unexpected dividends."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0055.desc.diplomacy:0 "The negotiations exceeded all expectations. Not only did the bandits disband, but several of their leaders swore service in exchange for clemency. In gratitude—or ambition—they revealed a hidden cache, stolen from a corrupt taxman and buried deep in the camp’s outskirts. The bandit threat is gone—and your coffers are heavier for it."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0055.a.martial:0 "The land is safe—and richer than before."
  lv_blocker_clearance.0055.a.diplomacy:0 "Peace and profit both. A rare thing indeed."

Deep in a collapsed shaft, amidst scorched stone and the skeletal remains of firewyrms, the miners uncovered a curious object.\n\nSmooth as polished onyx, veined with glowing embers, it pulses faintly in the sweltering air — warm to the touch, almost alive.

Passing through the doorway I can see that the room did indeed seem untouched by time, shelves of books rising far up towards the vaulted ceilings of the room containing knowledge that was likely thought lost to time.\n\nSomething directly across from the doorway caught my eye. As I walked across the room I noticed there stood a glass case, within the glass was a Valyrian Steel rapier, it's polished blue pommel accented by the multi-colored guard.
