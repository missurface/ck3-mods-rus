  trait_firewyrm_desc:0 "Twisted kin to dragons, the firewyrm is no creature of grace or sky. It crawls from deep beneath the earth, born of molten stone and madness, shaped by heat and time into a fire-breathing abomination. Where dragons inspire awe, firewyrms leave only scorched ruin and smoke-sickened death."

  lv_firewyrm_event.0001.t:0 "The Thing That Burns"
  lv_firewyrm_event.0001.desc:0 "The ruins groan under the weight of ages, yet it is not time nor tremor that shakes the ground beneath your feet. A shriek — no, a howl — cuts through the ash-choked air like a blade. And then it comes. Crawling out from a chasm of cracked stone and molten breath, the firewyrm descends upon the ruin like a demon from the old Valyrian scrolls.\n\nIt is no dragon. Its scales are jagged, blistered, and half-melted. Smoke hisses from vents along its serpentine spine, its breath a caustic blaze that blackens the very stones it treads. Its eyes — gods, its eyes — are molten, like open wounds, and it moves with a hunger that has nothing of instinct and everything of malice.\n\nEven the dragons feared firewyrms, they say. And what faces you now is no tame relic. It is a twisted remnant of Valyria's folly, a creature born not just of fire, but of madness.\n\nYou have only moments to choose — fight the beast, and perhaps become legend... or run, and hope the ruins are kind."

There is no kinship here, only hunger, only rage, as the air grows heavy with the promise of fire and ruin.\n\nIt drags itself from the ruin like a shard of the earth torn free, molten hide dripping heat in every movement. No wings. No majesty. Just a furnace of rage wrapped in cracked scale and smoke. Where your wyrm is flesh bound to flame, this one is flame unbound, a rival inferno straining against the leash of its own body.\n\nYour firewyrm rumbles deep, the sound rolling like stone collapsing in a cavern’s dark.

A jet of searing breath tore the air between you, faster than thought. Your mount roared in defiance, but the blaze caught its head and shoulders, bursting scale and flesh alike.\n\nYou felt the heat before you felt the pain—leather turning to liquid, skin to ash.

The ground split beneath the weight of dragon and wyrm alike.\n\nYou tried to rise, but there was no rising. The dragon’s fury pinned you where you sat, your firewyrm broken beneath you.

Your firewyrm thrashed, molten armor flaring, but the other pressed harder, heavier, an avalanche of flesh and fury. Its jaws closed around your beast’s neck, forcing it down, grinding until the air left its chest.\n\nYou screamed commands, but your wyrm could not rise.

One raked across your wyrm’s chest. The second ripped deeper, slicing through flesh and furnace-red sinew.\n\nThe sound was wet, tearing, unbearable. Your firewyrm howled, molten blood spilling out in a torrent that steamed against the stone. The glow in its body guttered like a dying forge.\n\nYou clung for a heartbeat, refusing to believe it—but your mount sagged beneath you, entrails spilling across the earth in glowing strands.

Entrails burst forth in a smoking, steaming flood, spilling across the battlefield. The stench of iron and fire overwhelmed the air.\n\nYour wyrm staggered, chest hollowed, its great body heaving once before the light in its molten eyes dulled to ash.

One tore through your dragon’s scales like parchment. The second found purchase deeper still.\n\nA horrific sound followed — a wet, tearing shriek that was neither your dragon’s cry nor your own. Entrails spilled into the ash-choked sky like steam from a ruptured forge. The scent of blood, molten and thick, overwhelmed even the sulfur and smoke.\n\nYou clung for a heartbeat longer, watching your dragon's eyes go dim as she buckled midair — a creature of majesty, undone not by fire, but by the raw savagery of a beast that should not be.#!"

Your firewyrm convulsed, molten blood spraying the ground in rivers that hissed and steamed.\n\nYou screamed the command, begged it to fight, but the killing slash had already come — gut laid open, glowing entrails spilling like slag from a broken crucible. The beast’s scream faltered, dimming to a hollow rumble as it collapsed beneath you.\n\nThe rival wyrm didn’t stop.
