  lv_travel_danger.0001.t:0 "The Fog Lives"
  lv_travel_danger.0001.desc:0 "The fog rises on the horizon like a wall — dense, unmoving, and wrong. It waits. As your ship enters, the fog swallows everything: the sea, the sky, the sound of the wind. The world behind you vanishes.\n\nThe air thickens. The sails disappear into gray. You can’t see your hands. Voices from the crew echo strangely, as if underwater. The ship groans, but even that sounds distant. Time twists. Minutes stretch. Hours pass — or none at all.\n\nThen a sailor stumbles out of the haze, barefoot and shaking. His skin is pale. His hair has gone white.\n\n“I found the ship,” he mutters. “Our ship. Just like this. Only... we were all dead. Floating. Staring. And I—I think I saw myself looking back at me.”"
  lv_travel_danger.0001.a:0 "The fog lies. Stay the course."

  lv_travel_danger.0002.t:0 "Blood on the Deck"
  lv_travel_danger.0002.desc:0 "There is blood on the planks. A sailor lies sprawled in death, a knife still buried in [victim.GetHerHis] ribs. Another stands over [victim.GetHerHim], trembling, face pale and spattered red.\n\n[victim.GetSheHe|U] wasn’t real,” the killer mutters, wide-eyed. “The fog sent [victim.GetHerHim]. I saw what [victim.GetSheHe] truly was.”\n\nThe crew gathers in uneasy silence. No one moves. No one speaks. The air hangs heavy with fear — and the knowledge that sanity is fraying."

  lv_travel_danger.0002.b:0 "Throw [killer.GetHerHim] overboard."
