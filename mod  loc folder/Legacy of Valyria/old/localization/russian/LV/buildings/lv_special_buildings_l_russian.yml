No longer just a lone tower, it now stands as a fully restored keep and stronghold, its colossal Valyrian Blackstone walls stretching high and thick, a monument to dominance and dread.\n\nLike the Crimson Gate, the walls of the Red Citadel were once infused with blood magic rituals performed by the ancient Valyrians, their sorcery forever staining the stone a deep, unnatural crimson. Though the rituals have long since faded into history, their dark legacy endures, making the citadel not only a near-impenetrable stronghold, but also a haunting symbol of absolute power.\n\nAt its heart, The Red Tower pierces the sky, its presence casting a long shadow over the city, a constant reminder of the archon's authority. The lower walls and courtyard remain slick with blood, not only from the rituals of the past but from the countless executions, betrayals, and brutal conflicts that have played out upon its stones. The blood of rebels, conspirators, and enemies of the state has seeped into its foundations, ensuring that fear is woven into the very fabric of the fortress.\n\nIt is whispered that within these walls, the Red Death first took root, a curse that once ravaged Gogossos, leaving entire districts drowning in blood and suffering. Though the disease has long faded into history, some say the citadel still remembers, that the ghosts of the dying linger in its deepest chambers, whispering to those who listen.\n\nA place of iron rule and legend, the Red Citadel is more than just a fortress—it is the unyielding core of Gogossos, a place where power is absolute, mercy is scarce, and rebellion is crushed before it can begin." #NT!

Twisting hedges, grown wild and unnatural, form an intricate labyrinth, their paths shifting and closing like living things, leading the unwary deeper into confusion. Among the tangled greenery lurk plants of impossible colors and unnatural shapes, their beauty masking deadly intent. Some release spores that choke the lungs, others secrete toxins that blister the skin, and a few move with unsettling purpose, waiting for prey to draw too close.\n\nLegends whisper that something—perhaps the remnants of a forgotten sorcery, or the lingering presence of whatever force once ruled here—keeps the flora thriving in ways that defy nature. The ruins remain untouched, not because they are forgotten, but because they are feared.
