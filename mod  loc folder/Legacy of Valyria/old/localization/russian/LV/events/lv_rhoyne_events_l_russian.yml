From the banks of the mighty river to every distant tributary, life and prosperity will bloom under one banner. Traders fill the waterways of our reborn empire, flowing like blood into every corner of our borders. Our people now secure in the knowledge that they will never again be forced into exile. The future of the Rhoynar begins here, with a promise of strength and unity along the Mother Rhoyne." #NT!

For I have done what no one has achieved since the days of legend—I have united the Rhoynar people once more.\n\nNow, as traders journey along the Mother Rhoyne and her countless tributaries, life and prosperity once more flow to every corner of our reborn empire. Much work lies ahead, but one thing is certain: never again shall our people be forced to flee as Princess Nymeria once did.\n\nThe future is ours to shape, here on the banks of the Rhoyne." #NT!
