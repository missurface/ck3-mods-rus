 lv_settlement_event.0001.t: "To Claim What Was Lost" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0001.desc: "The time has come to act on your ambitions. The shattered lands have been surveyed, and a plan is in place—though perilous, the opportunity to restore life to these forsaken grounds is within reach. Roads must be mapped, supplies gathered, settlers recruited, and a leader appointed. The question remains: who shall guide this founding endeavor?" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0001.a: "I will reclaim [ruin.GetNameNoTooltip] personally." #NT!

 lv_settlement_event.0001.c: "I will send a loyal vassal." #NT!

 lv_settlement_event.0002.t: "To Claim What Was Lost" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0002.desc: "The time has come to act on your ambitions. The shattered lands have been surveyed, and a plan is in place—though perilous, the opportunity to restore life to these forsaken grounds is within reach. Roads must be mapped, supplies gathered, settlers recruited, and a leader appointed. The question remains: who shall guide this founding endeavor?" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0002.a: "Splendid." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0002.b: "I've changed my mind." #NT!
  
 lv_settlement_event.0003.t: "A Command From On High" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0003.desc: "A messenger arrives, bearing the seal of your liege and a summons heavy with implication. You are to lead an expedition to reclaim and settle [ruin.GetName]—ruined, wild, and half-swallowed by time. It is no small task: the journey is long, the outcome uncertain, and the burden of command heavy.\n\nBut with risk comes reward. Should the settlement take root, it may bring glory, wealth, and lasting legacy. And should it fail... the tale will be yours to wear.\n\nSoldiers and settlers await your word. The banner does not yet rise—but all eyes turn to you." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0003.a: "I shall see it done. Let them say I carved my name from ruin." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0003.a.tt: "You accept the command and prepare to lead the expedition in your liege's name." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0003.b: "Let another chase shadows and dust." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0003.b.tt: "You respectfully decline the assignment, leaving your liege to find someone else." #NT!
  
 lv_settlement_event.0004.t: "A Refusal Returned" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0004.desc: "Word returns not with the trumpet of assent, but with silence and a sealed letter. Your appointed vassal, for reasons their own, has declined the honor—and burden—of leading the expedition. Whether from caution, contempt, or simple practicality, the task has been refused.\n\nThe settlers still wait. The wagons remain laden. The road winds on, but it seems you must name another to walk it... or wait until the time is better suited for such ambition." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0004.a: "Then I shall find someone with greater resolve." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0004.a.tt: "You will seek another who is willing to take on the challenge." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0004.b: "The winds are not right for this. Not yet." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0004.b.tt: "You decide to wait for a more opportune moment to undertake the expedition." #NT!
  
 lv_settlement_event.0010.t: "En Route to [ruin.GetNameNoTooltip]" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0010.desc.self: "The final preparations are made. Provisions are measured, tools inspected, and the last of the wagons lashed shut beneath gray morning skies. Your mount waits at the head of the caravan, its breath misting in the chill air. Behind you lie the comforts of court, the murmur of servants and stewards, the easy weight of command. Ahead: broken roads, long days, and a land that remembers only fire and silence.\n\nYou are no mere traveler now, but a bearer of legacy. With each hoofbeat and rattle of cartwheel, you carry the weight of your name toward a place that might—if the gods are kind—rise from ruin.\n\nAs the gates open and the wind stirs your cloak, your courtiers bow in silence, some crossing their hearts, others watching grimly. The path is set. The land will not wait forever." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0010.desc.other: "Your chosen leader sits astride their horse, armor polished, banners furled for the long road ahead. Behind them gather the expedition’s caravan—craftsmen and guards, oxen-led wagons, and rough folk with calloused hands and wary eyes. The appointed captain salutes you once more from the saddle, a silent vow passing between you both. They go not merely to tame the wilderness, but to raise your standard above the bones of what was.\n\nThe journey will be long, and not all who set out may return. But with luck and strong leadership, the settlement will rise, stone upon stone, beneath your name.\n\nAlready, the gates creak open. Already, the dust begins to rise." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0010.a: "Toward the promise of a new beginning." #NT!
  
 lv_settlement_event.0011.t.self_liege: "By My Own Hand" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.t.self_non_liege: "In My Liege's Name" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.t.other_liege: "The Banner Rises" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.t.other_non_liege: "A Flame Rekindled" #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.desc.self_liege: "The ground is broken, the walls raised, and the fires lit. What once lay choked in ash and overgrowth now echoes with the rhythm of hammers and hope. You stood not behind command halls or parchment—but beneath open sky, guiding every stone, every soul.\n\nThe people speak your name not just as lord or lady, but as founder. A claim won by courage, carved with sweat and iron. This place breathes because you dared to lead." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.desc.self_non_liege: "Your boots were the first to tread the old stones. It was by your hand the tents were raised, the defenses laid, and the settlers steeled to the task. What rises here may belong to your liege—but it stands because you willed it.\n\nSome will forget. The nobles at court may toast your success with hollow words. But the settlers will not forget. Nor will the land." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.desc.other_liege: "The expedition you commanded has borne fruit. Your appointed leader reports that the first stones have been laid and fires now warm the bellies of settlers. It is a beginning, humble perhaps, but carried on the back of your vision.\n\nThe wild is beaten back—if only by inches—and the land stirs once more to the call of banners and law. In time, it will thrive. In time, it will remember whose banner made it possible." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.desc.other_non_liege: "The ravens speak of renewal. Far from your own lands, a forgotten province now stirs with life—its ruins cleared, its walls rising anew under the command of a distant lord. Whether driven by ambition, duty, or madness, they have succeeded.\n\nIt is said the old world sleeps beneath the ashes. Perhaps now, it begins to wake." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.a.self_liege: "Let this land remember who gave it life." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.a.self_non_liege: "It was not glory I sought—but I earned it all the same." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.a.other_liege: "Let the realm know this land was reclaimed by my word." #NT!
 lv_settlement_event.0011.a.other_non_liege: "Best to keep an eye on such things." #NT!
