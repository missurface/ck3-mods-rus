Many have dreamed of reviving the legacy of the [valyrian_freehold_short|E], and even fewer have dared to attempt. The [free_cities|E]—having resisted attempts at subjugation numerous times prior—are themselves still proud of their Valyrian heritage, with each in some form asserting themselves as the true heirs to [valyria|E]. To establish yourself as its successor state would no doubt signal to them your intentions of dominion over the [valyrian_freehold_short|E]'s former lands."
