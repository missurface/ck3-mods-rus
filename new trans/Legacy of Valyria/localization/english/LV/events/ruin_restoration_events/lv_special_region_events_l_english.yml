  ## Special Locations
  # Valyria
  lv_special_region_event.0001.t.valyria:0 "Valyria"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.valyria:0 "You stand upon the edge of legend. Valyria—once the heart of empire, cradle of dragons, and seat of arcane might—now lies before you. The land breathes strange and slow, its skies tinted by ancient ash and heat. No map can guide you here, only the weight of history and the caution of those who know how high greatness soared... and how far it fell.\n\n"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.valyria.ruined:0 "This is not a place—this is a wound. Towers of twisted stone claw at the sky, half-melted by flame no forge could birth. Rivers boil beneath the earth, and whispers echo where no mouths remain. The Doom was not a storm or a war—it was annihilation made manifest. And yet, even now, fragments of Valyria's power pulse faintly beneath the ash."
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.valyria.restored:0 "Some dared return. Among obsidian rubble and shattered dragonroads, new foundations rise. Brave—or mad—souls walk the old ways again, taming pockets of stable ground and rebuilding atop cursed soil. The ghosts of the Freehold linger, but so too does promise. This is not the Valyria of old... but it may yet become something new."
  lv_special_region_event.0001.a.valyria:0 "This place should not be, and yet... here it is."

  # Lands of the Long Summer
  lv_special_region_event.0001.t.lands_of_the_long_summer:0 "Lands of the Long Summer"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.lands_of_the_long_summer:0 "The horizon shifts. Ash-grey cliffs rise over sun-bleached coastlands, and the wind carries the distant scent of salt, sulfur, and old power. You have crossed into the Lands of the Long Summer—where Valyria’s shadow once stretched across the known world. The sky seems heavier here, the air thicker with stories untold and legacies undone. To set foot in these lands is to tread between greatness and grave.\n\n"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.lands_of_the_long_summer.ruined:0 "What remains is but the ghost of glory. Roads choked with blackened vine, marble halls shattered and half-sunken, and statues worn smooth by centuries of ash storms. Nothing stirs but the wind through broken colonnades. The Doom did not simply kill a people—it unraveled their very memory. Yet even in ruin, the bones of power remain."
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.lands_of_the_long_summer.restored:0 "Though the scars of the Doom linger, life has returned. New banners fly over ancient towers, and foreign tongues echo through rebuilt streets. Traders haggle in markets built atop shattered palaces, and smoke rises not from volcanoes, but hearths. The land is changed—but not dead. It lives again, reshaped by bold hands unafraid to claim a cursed inheritance."
  lv_special_region_event.0001.a.lands_of_the_long_summer:0 "Perhaps the land remembers more than the living."

  # Smoking Sea
  lv_special_region_event.0001.t.smoking_sea:0 "The Smoking Sea"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.smoking_sea:0 "You sail into silence broken only by the hiss of unseen tides. The Smoking Sea stretches endlessly, a mirror of shadow and smoke where stars vanish and compasses turn traitor. Once a cradle for Valyria’s power, it is now a place shunned by sailor and scholar alike. Charts mark it only with warnings. No one agrees where it ends—only that it changes those who cross it. \n\n"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.smoking_sea.ruined:0 "Your vessel glides into the waters of the Smoking Sea, though “water” seems too generous a word. The waves hiss as if wounded, steam coils like spirits rising from a battlefield, and the very air tastes of ash and burnt stone. Sailors whisper of ghostly shadows moving beneath the surface — shapes too large, too silent, too knowing. Every board creaks with unease. Some say the Doom never truly ended here — it only sank, and waits."
  lv_special_region_event.0001.desc.smoking_sea.restored:0 "You cross the borders of the Smoking Sea and are met not with scalding mists or choking fumes, but a strange, reverent silence. The water lies still — no longer boiling, no longer whispering. The sky above remains a sullen gray, yet it no longer weeps soot or screams thunder. No shapes stir below the surface, and yet the unease lingers, like a silence too long held. You are the first in generations to sail these waters unchallenged. But at what cost did the sea fall silent?"
  lv_special_region_event.0001.a.smoking_sea:0 "Smoke or stillness, this place remembers what we’ve forgotten."
