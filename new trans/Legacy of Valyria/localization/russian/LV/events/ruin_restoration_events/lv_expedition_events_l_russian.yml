   ## Expedition Events 
 lv_expedition_event.0010.a.tt: "You make camp and begin your preparations for the expedition ahead." #NT!
  
   # Valyria 
 lv_expedition_event.0010.t.valyria: "At the Edge of Doom" #NT!
 lv_expedition_event.0010.desc.valyria: "Your vessel drifts toward a broken shore, where jagged stone and obsidian spires claw at the horizon like the remains of some ancient god. The air is heavy—charged, as if it remembers fire. Valyria looms, fractured and breathing. Once the heart of an empire of dragons, now a place spoken of in fear, myth, and longing. Whatever awaits you here, it has been waiting a very long time." #NT!
 lv_expedition_event.0010.a.valyria: "The Doom has passed. But has it ended?" #NT!
  
   # Lands of the Long Summer 
 lv_expedition_event.0010.t.lands_of_the_long_summer: "Beneath the Ashen Sky" #NT!
 lv_expedition_event.0010.desc.lands_of_the_long_summer: "The sea recedes behind you, and the land rises ahead—sun-blasted, scorched, and still. The Lands of the Long Summer stretch outward like the ribs of a buried beast. Dragonroads cut through blackened hills, and the bones of old dominion lie cracked beneath wild growth and shifting ash. This is where Valyria’s shadow first fell upon the world. Now, you follow its footsteps, uncertain what may answer." #NT!
 lv_expedition_event.0010.a.lands_of_the_long_summer: "Here, even ruin has memory." #NT!
  
   ## Expedition Progress Events 
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0001.t: "A Tunnel Too Deep" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0001.desc: "As part of the expedition’s efforts to chart the vast and twisting cave systems beneath the region, a small splinter team was sent ahead to probe deeper passages beyond the main survey route. When they failed to return by nightfall, unease gripped the camp.\n\nFor a full day, there was no sign of them—until they staggered back, dust-covered and visibly shaken.\n\nThey speak of a descent past broken stairs and worn statues, of air that turned still and cold, and of strange carvings etched in patterns no one recognized. At the edge of their torchlight, they found a vast chasm—bottomless, silent, and ancient.\n\nThey refused to go further. Something, they claim, was watching." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0001.a: "Mark the path. We may return when we are ready." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.t: "The Call of the Void" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.desc: "Though sealed from view, the chasm beyond the marked path lingers in the minds of your expedition. Those who glimpsed it find themselves restless, their thoughts spiraling back to the black pit and the carvings surrounding it. Others speak of hearing things at night—soft murmurs beneath the earth, or the distant sound of falling stones where none have fallen.\n\nIt is as if the abyss is waiting. Watching. Calling.\n\nSome urge caution, fearing whatever may dwell in the depths. Others suggest that such mysteries should not be left buried. The decision rests with you." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.a: "Let it remain untouched. Some doors are best left unopened." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.b: "Collapse the entrance. We were not meant to find this." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.c: "Ready the ropes and lanterns. We go deeper." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0002.d: "There's something behind those carvings. We must know what it is." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0003.t: "The Carvings Stir" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0003.desc: "The chasm remains untouched, its path unsealed but avoided. Yet in the days that follow, unease settles over the camp like morning mist.\n\nThe splinter team that first glimpsed the abyss begins to complain of strange dreams—visions of falling endlessly through black stone, or being watched by unseen eyes. Some speak of symbols that glow behind their eyelids when they close them, pulsing with a rhythm not their own.\n\nWhispers fill the silence between tents at night. A wind that doesn’t stir the trees sighs through the caves.\n\nAnd though no one dares return to the edge, something behind the rock remembers." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0003.a: "Let no one go near it again." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0003.a.tt: "You distance your team from the carved path. The tension lingers." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0004.t: "Seal the Passage" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0004.desc: "You give the order, and within the day, your team sets to work. Stone and soil are dislodged with care, then with urgency, as the chasm is buried beneath tons of rock and debris. Dust chokes the air as the final stones are set, and for a moment, it feels like the darkness beneath your feet has been silenced.\n\nBut the quiet does not last.\n\nThe nights grow still in an unfamiliar way—too still. Your people sleep uneasily. Tools go missing, found later placed in patterns no one recalls arranging. And when the wind blows across the sealed cavern, it sounds like breath caught between clenched teeth.\n\nThe void has been buried... not forgotten." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0004.a: "Let it stay buried. Whatever it was, it's done." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0004.a.tt: "The passage is sealed, but something still stirs beneath." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0005.t: "Echoes in the Deep" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0005.desc: "With ropes secured and lanterns lit, your team descends into the dark. The air thickens as you go deeper, stale and unmoved by time. Walls once smooth become jagged, and the carvings—twisting, alien shapes—grow more frequent and intricate.\n\nThen the sound begins.\n\nAt first, it’s only the echo of your own steps, but it shifts. Warps. Footfalls double back as if mimicked. Voices bounce from wall to wall—soft, distant, almost familiar. One lantern bearer drops his light, claiming someone whispered his name from the blackness.\n\nEventually, you reach a stone platform above a yawning void. The chasm plunges deeper than your torches can reach. And from within it... something calls. Not in words, but in sensation—a pull at your bones, a pressure behind your eyes.\n\nSomething ancient is down here. Watching." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0005.a: "Hold your ground. Take readings, record everything." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0005.a.tt: "You press on carefully, documenting what lies below." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0006.t: "What Lurks Beneath" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0006.desc: "Despite the mounting unease, your expedition presses on. The carvings begin to shift in tone—less like art, more like warnings. Circles of jagged symbols line the rock around what appears to be an ancient well or altar, its edges scorched as though from fire... or something older.\n\nThen, without warning, a tremor shudders through the stone. The deepest shadows ripple. One of your scholars collapses, clutching their head, muttering a language no one recognizes.\n\nYou stand on the edge of something vast—be it knowledge, ruin, or awakening." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0006.a: "No artifact is worth what lies here. We leave." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0006.b: "We’ve come this far. We see it through." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0007.t: "Turn Away the Abyss" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0007.desc: "With the unease growing unbearable and the air itself thick with dread, you sound the retreat. The team moves quickly, leaving behind the strange platform and the relic it bore. The darkness seems almost reluctant to release you.\n\nBack at camp, silence reigns. The team is shaken, but intact. The expedition returns with sketches, inscriptions, and tales none will believe. You have not touched the void—but it touched you.\n\nAnd it remembers." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0007.a: "Some doors are best left unopened." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0007.a.tt: "You return safely... with knowledge, and unease." #NT!
  
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0008.t: "The Deepest Chamber" #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0008.desc: "Your descent continues beyond the etched walls and into a space untouched for millennia. At the heart of the void lies a stone dais, carved with spirals that seem to move when not looked at directly. On it rests an object—smooth, dark, and humming with cold energy. A relic? A prison?\n\nAs you step closer, the pressure in your ears becomes unbearable. Several members of the team collapse. Light flickers and dies, but not before one final glimpse of something vast stirring beyond the veil—serpentine, winged, or perhaps formless entirely.\n\nYou seize the object and retreat, the walls shaking as the chamber reacts. The way out collapses behind you, sealing the void once again." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0008.a: "We carry it out, no matter the cost." #NT!
 lv_expedition_progress_event.0008.a.tt: "You recover a powerful and dangerous artifact... but something may have followed." #NT!
