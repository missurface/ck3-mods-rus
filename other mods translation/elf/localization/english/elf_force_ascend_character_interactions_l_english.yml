    elf_force_ascend.001.title:0 "Forceful Ascension!"
    elf_force_ascend.001.desc:0 "The sudden jolt of energy was like nothing they had ever experienced. It was as if the very essence of the cosmos had been channeled through their mortal body, tearing it apart molecule by molecule, only to reconstruct it in a form that was both terrifying and magnificent. They lay on the cold stone table, bound by ancient runes that glowed with a predatory intensity, as the ritual masters chanted incantations in a language lost to time. The air grew thick with anticipation, and the very fabric of reality seemed to stretch and bend around the table, as if it were a mere canvas for the artistry of the gods themselves.\n\nThe transformation began with a searing pain that shot through every nerve ending, a conflagration that threatened to consume them entirely. Bones popped and shifted, reshaping themselves into something more lithe and agile. Muscles stretched and grew, adapting to the new form that was taking hold. The skin rippled and changed color, shifting through a spectrum of hues before settling into an ethereal pallor that seemed to shimmer in the dim light of the chamber. Hair grew longer and finer, taking on a silken texture that felt more like spun moonlight than the coarse human locks they had once known. The features of their face elongated, becoming sharp and refined, with pointed ears that pierced the air like delicate sculptures carved from the purest ivory."
